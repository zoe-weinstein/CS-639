# Computer Science 639: Data Management for Data Scientists
University of Wisconsin, Madison
Fall 2024




Welcome to Data Management for Data Science! This course covers data processing and management tools like relational databases and NoSQL for processing large volumes of data. Data engineering techniques like data lakes and warehouses, ETL vs ELT, data mesh, and data pipelines will be covered. NLP concepts like vector databases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) will be covered, along with predictive analysis topics like time series analysis, boosting techniques like XGBoost, LightGBM. Visualization techniques like t-SNE, data storytelling, and sunburst plots will be covered. Majority of the programming will be in Python.

Lecture (Meeting Time and Location)
LEC001 Sewell Social Sciences 5208 01:20 PM - 02:10 PM
We meet 3 times a week -- see the lecture schedule here.
I'll ask questions during lecture via TopHat. Answering questions (and getting them correct) will help your participation score, though perfect attendance is not necessary for full credit.
Instructional Modality
LEC001: in-person
Learning Objectives
Manage large datasets using SQL and NoSQL databases and write programs to analyse the datasets
Understand data integration techniques like ETL, ELT
Extract and optimize data into a data lake
Understanding critical role of semantic layers in data management
Demonstrate competencies with tools like MongoDB, Apache Iceberg, Snowflake
Understand and apply predictive analysis techniques like timeseries analysis, and boosting
Demonstrate visualization competencies for creating data stories, dashboards
Readings
We'll be learning about many different data management systems, and so no textbook closely corresponds to the lecture content. Thus, attending lectures and taking notes will be your primary resource.

We will have recommended (though optional) readings.

Here are some of the main texts we'll reference this semester:

Fundamentals of Data Engineering by Joe Reis & Matt Housley
Big Book of Data Engineering by databricks
Data Engineering with Python by Paul Crickard
Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems (1st edition), by Martin Kleppmann
You can read O'Reilly text books free online via the Madison Public Library. You just need to do the following:
get a library card (free)
sign into the O'Reilly collection with your card number
search for the assigned book
Communication
We message the class regularly via Canvas announcements. We recommend updating your Canvas settings so that the "Announcement" option is "Notify immediately" so that you don't miss something important.

See the help page for details about how to contact us.

We have various forms for us to leave (optionally anonymous) feedback, report lab attendance, and thank TAs.

Course Components
Grading breakdown

Midterm (15%)
Final (20%)
12 quizzes (12% total)
8 programming projects (6% each, 48% total)
participation (5% total)
At the end of the semester, you'll have a score out of 100, which will be mapped to a letter grade (see below).

Letter Grades
At the end of the semester, we will assign final grades based on these thresholds:

93% - 100%: A
88% - 92%: AB
80% - 87%: B
75% - 79%: BC
70% - 74%: C
60% - 69% D
I will reserve my decision on rounding decimal points to the end of the semester.

Exams
These will be multiple choice exams taken in person. The midterm and the final will be at a different location (to be announced).

Midterm will be held on Wednesday, October, 16th

Quizzes
There will be a short Canvas quiz due at the end of most Wednesdays. Make sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed and what is not.
