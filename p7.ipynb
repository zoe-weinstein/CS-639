Recall that at the end\\n', 'of the last lecture, even though I created an index\\n', \"called nyc_ restaurants, I also deleted it. So it's likely that my delete\\n\", \"operation now would fail. Let's go ahead and\\n\", 'do a quick review of how to perform the\\n', 'delete operation. You need to say\\n', 'client.indices.delete, and you need to\\n', 'specify the argument corresponding to the\\n', 'parameter index, and the argument here is\\n', \"going to be nyc_index. When you're trying to delete\\n\", \"a non existent index, you're going to encounter\\n\", 'not found error, which is part of\\n', 'elastic search module. So it is essential\\n', 'that you associate the delete method invocation\\n', \"with a tri block. So I'm just going to move the delete invocation\\n\", 'into a tri block.

Let me just make a\\n', \"simple print statement saying index doesn't exist. And let me go ahead\\n\", 'and rerun the cell. Now, even though the\\n', \"index does not exist, you're not going to run\\n\", \"into not found error. It's a good habit to\\n\", 'always make sure to handle error\\n', 'scenarios correctly. Once we have assured\\n', 'that we have deleted any previous\\n', \"version of the index, let's go ahead and invoke\\n\", 'the create method. Once again, using\\n', 'client.indices.create.

Hopefully, JSON_files is going to have two different\\n', \"JSON files, as you can see, there's\\n\", \"Version 1 and Version 2. Let's learn how to\\n\", 'process Version 1, which is the version where your outer data\\n', 'structure is an array, and each restaurant\\n', 'inspection information is within an inner dictionary, which is an item within the outer array and for\\n', \"processing that version, we're going to learn\\n\", 'about the bulk method, which we can invoke directly using the client\\n', 'object instance. Both bulk methods are\\n', 'going to require you to format your data in\\n', \"a specific manner. Let's first learn how\\n\", \"to format the data for the bulk method associated with the client object instance. So for this bulk method, you're going to pass an argument to the\\n\", \"parameter operations. Let me fix that typo here. It's operations and not\\n\", 'operation. My apologies. So the argument is going to\\n', 'be a list of dictionaries. In the outer list, every alternate dictionary is going to be the\\n', 'document dictionary. But the other dictionary\\n', 'is going to provide you the details associated\\n', 'with the index. For instance, the\\n', 'name of the index, which is going to go as a value corresponding to the\\n', 'inner field_index. And if you want,\\n', 'you can manually generate the ID corresponding\\n', \"to each of the documents, but we're going to skip that\\n\", \"part and take a look at the auto generated ID field. So, let's go ahead and\\n\", 'process Version 1 JSON. I am going to be using\\n', 'the JSON module, load function in order to load the content into a\\n', 'Python variable. I am going to make sure to use os.path.join so as\\n', 'to not hard code, the type of slash for\\n', 'my Linux platform here.

Let me open the file using read mode and use the file object\\n', \"instance references F and I'm going to\\n\", 'say json.load(f). Let me capture the return value into a variable\\n', 'called restaurants because we directly have a list of restaurant\\n', \"dictionaries. So let's define a list\\n\", 'called operations, which we are going\\n', 'to be populating. I can simply iterate\\n', 'over every restaurant in the restaurants\\n', 'list that I got from having used load\\n', 'function in order to populate my operations\\n', \"list over here. I'm simply going to say four\\n\", 'restaurant in restaurants. I need to use the append method to keep appending dictionaries into my outer list,\\n', \"which is operations. We'll come back to\\n\", 'the first dictionary, which is supposed to\\n', \"contain the index details. The second dictionary is easy to populate because we're\\n\", 'just going to take every restaurant\\n', 'dictionary and put it as every alternate\\n', 'dictionary within the outer list over here. So that fills in this\\n', 'second dictionary, which is going to be\\n', 'the field value of pairs associated\\n', 'with the document. For the first one, we need to\\n', 'define the field as index, and the value is going to\\n', \"be an inner dictionary, and in there, you're going\\n\", 'to have an _index field. Hopefully, all of\\n', 'you remember from our initial exploration\\n', 'of the Python APA, that this field name\\n', \"is very similar to the output that you get with the search and the get methods.

And let me store the result value into a\\n', \"variable called bulk output. And let's take a peek at\\n\", 'bulk output over here. So as you can see, the bulk method\\n', 'when invoked with the client object instance\\n', 'produces this huge output, which is going to contain, all of the document\\n', 'information that has been indexed using that particular\\n', 'bulk method invocation. And if you take a\\n', 'look at the items, corresponding to the\\n', \"field items over here, you'll notice that\\n\", 'the _ID field, which we skipped\\n', \"manually assigning the IDs gets auto generated.

How do you get the mappings associated with an\\n', \"index or indeces, that's going to be using\\n\", \"get_mappings method. And you're going to\\n\", 'invoke that using client object instance by saying\\n', \"client.indices.get_mapping, and you're going\\n\", 'to pass argument corresponding to the\\n', 'parameter index as nyc_index. Let me go ahead and\\n', 'execute the cell. This provides a detailed\\n', 'mapping information associated with the index\\n', 'that we just populated. As you can see, the name of the index is nyc_restaurants, and then you have a\\n', 'mappings dictionary, which contains all\\n', 'of the field names, including things like action, boro, and cuisine description, and many other\\n', 'significant fields from the inner dictionaries\\n', \"corresponding to each restaurant's inspection. As you can see, associated\\n\", 'with each field is the type of the data that is\\n', 'being stored in that field. The search operations\\n', 'that you can use in elastic search are\\n', 'highly dependent on what kind of type of data is associated with the\\n', 'index that you apply.

Let's move to, learning\\n\", 'about helpers bulk method, which is now going to\\n', 'enable us to process Version 2 of the dataset, which is very similar to the JSON file format\\n', 'from Project P4.

Let me go ahead and modify the pasted\\n', 'value to Version 2, and I am going to make sure to open the file\\n', 'using read mode, and let me go ahead and read the content into a\\n', 'variable called data. There is a reason\\n', \"that I'm reading the content into a\\n\", \"variable called data. That's because remember\\n\", 'that in Version 2, you now have a dictionary\\n', \"instead of a list. So I'm making sure to extract the inner list by using\\n\", \"dictionary lookup operation. And I'm going to say\\n\", 'data of restaurants.

So the field of significance here is going to\\n', 'be the BORO field, which is going to\\n', 'give you the area in which that particular\\n', \"restaurant is located. Clearly, that's going to be\\n\", \"the field of interest for us. Let's go ahead and invoke\\n\", 'the search method. And in order to invoke\\n', 'the search method, we are going to have\\n', 'to specify what is the name of the index,\\n', \"which is nyc_index. And you're going to have to specify your argument\\n\", 'corresponding to the second parameter\\n', 'that I mentioned briefly, the last time when we\\n', \"invoked search method, it's going to be body parameter. And the argument\\n\", 'here is going to be a dictionary object instance. And let me just move\\n', 'that dictionary into a new line here. Within that particular\\n', 'dictionary, your key is going to be\\n', 'a field called query. Inside, sorry, not inside, associated with that key is going to be another\\n', 'inner dictionary. In there, you can use the term match to perform\\n', 'simplistic search matches. And since we only want to\\n', 'do a simple search here, the match field is going to have an innermost\\n', \"dictionary as the value, and that's going to have the field value pair that\\n\", \"you're trying to match here. And going back to the JSON data, as you can see,\\n\", 'the field is BORO, and the value is Manhattan. So let me go ahead and\\n', 'type the BORO: and then you have Manhattan\\n', 'as your search term. And this is going to perform case insensitive search for you. So even if Manhattan is, spelled out with,\\n', \"a lower case m, it is still going to be able to retrieve all such restaurants. For now, I'm just going to\\n\", 'go ahead and comment this. I am going to show you what is the output\\n', \"object instance. Let me capture the return value into a variable called response. And I'm just going to go ahead\\n\", 'and show you the response. As you can see, the\\n', 'response object instance, like the previous\\n', 'search invocation that we did has this\\n', 'important hits field, which corresponds\\n', 'to a dictionary, which is going to contain all\\n', 'the relevant information. The most important\\n', 'inner field within that hits dictionary is\\n', 'going to be the hits field, which corresponds to a list of all the document hits that particular search\\n', 'operation got for us. So because of that,\\n', \"most of the times, you're going to be processing\\n\", 'the inner hits field within the outer response object instance by saying\\n', \"response of hits of hits. This is going to retrieve, the list of hits for you. And I'm going to iterate\\n\", 'over each hit here and retrieve the\\n', \"relevant fields. I'm going to retrieve the\\n\", 'name of the restaurant, which was subject\\n', 'to the inspection, and the area of the inspection, also the building\\n', 'information street address. So hopefully, we should be able to see the street address, for all the restaurants\\n', 'in Manhattan that have had to go\\n', \"through an inspection. At this point, I'd\\n\", 'like to mention that I actually generated this JSON dataset from the New\\n', 'York open dataset. But I did quite a\\n', 'bit of sampling. I actually got it down to\\n', '100th of the original size. So this might not be\\n', 'actually representative of what are all the\\n', 'Manhattan restaurants that have gone through\\n', 'an inspection. Since this is a sample dataset. You do have like some\\n', \"Manhattan restaurants that are showing up over here. So that's an example\\n\", \"where you'll be using body parameter\\n\", 'argument to perform simple search with respect to enforcing a\\n', \"particular condition. In this case, it's going to be a simple case insensitive\\n\", \"match based search. Let's move to the\\n\", 'next search question, which is going to ask us to find all inspected\\n', \"pizza restaurants. That is, we're going to find any match that has pizza as part of the\\n\", \"name of the restaurant. I'm going to copy paste the\\n\", 'search method invocation from the previous question\\n', 'and make modifications here. Now, instead of the BORO field, I am interested in the\\n', \"name of the restaurants, so that's going to\\n\", 'be the DBA field, and I am going to type a\\n', \"Pizza here as my search term. And let's take a\\n\", \"look at the result. And this time, I'm\\n\", 'only going to print the name of the\\n', 'matching restaurants. As you can see, the case\\n', \"here doesn't really matter. In fact, match can\\n\", 'actually perform, just like regs based searches, that it is not going\\n', 'to expect the name of the restaurants that are\\n', 'matching to be exactly pizza. Instead, it can\\n', \"just contain pizza. Match here is quite powerful. It's going to enable you to find matching occurrences of\\n\", \"individual phrases as well. And that's another\\n\", \"simple search example. Let's move on to a\\n\", \"fuzzy search example. Let me redefine what's\\n\", 'meant by fuzzy search. Whenever you want to find search results that are\\n', 'similar to a different term, or whenever you have a typo, but you still want the\\n', \"search to be successful. That's when you're going to\\n\", 'be performing a fuzziness, adding on a fuzziness\\n', \"factor to the search. And that's what we're\\n\", 'going to do now. Let me paste the query that we used for the very\\n', \"first simple search question. And then we'll keep working\\n\", \"on modification for that. So once again, we're going to be using the match base search. And this time, we\\n\", 'want to find all of the inspected\\n', 'restaurants whose names are similar to Mamma Mia. So clearly, I need to\\n', 'mention the DBA field, and I need to type Mamma Mia as the value of corresponding to\\n', 'the key DBA here. Other than that, I also need to specify a fuzziness factor, which means that\\n', \"I'll have to change how this match\\n\", 'dictionary is formatted. So instead of\\n', 'directly mentioning the field and the corresponding\\n', \"search term here, we're now going to update the value as an\\n\", 'inner dictionary, and within that\\n', \"inner dictionary, just give me one second, I'm just going to delete\\n\", 'this Mamma Mia shortly so that we can have\\n', 'proper formatting. So, inside the\\n', 'innermost dictionary corresponding to\\n', \"the field where we want to apply first C search on, you're going to be\\n\", 'using another field, which is going to be query, and the corresponding\\n', \"value is going to be your fuzzy search string. And then you're going to add\\n\", \"another field value pair. This time, the field name is going to be called fuzziness, and I'm just going to have like auto setting for\\n\", \"fuzziness and not like, do any specific settings. And once again, we're\\n\", 'only interested in the name of the\\n', 'matching restaurants. As you can see,\\n', 'corresponding to Mia, you get matching\\n', 'results like mix, FRESH MIX, TACO MIX, CAFE MIX, and so on. And corresponding to mamma. The exact spelling\\n', \"doesn't really matter. You're getting matches\\n\", 'like MAMA BELLA, MAMA TACO, MAMA\\n', 'SUSHI, and so on. That is an example\\n', 'of a fuzzy search. As I mentioned,\\n', \"elastic search is very powerful as opposed to MongoDB text based search. Let's learn two\\n\", 'more options here, which are match_phrase\\n', 'and multi_match, which are going to\\n', 'come in handy for the next couple of\\n', \"questions here. For Q4, let's find all\\n\", 'inspected restaurants whose violations have the\\n', 'phrase food worker within them. So let me go ahead and start typing the search\\n', 'method invocation. The index here is\\n', 'going to be nyc_index. The body is going to have a\\n', \"dictionary as an argument. Let's start with the\\n\", \"query that's going to be the field and the\\n\", \"corresponding value is going to be a dictionary. And instead of match, this time, we're going to\\n\", 'have match_phrase, and the corresponding value is going to be an\\n', 'inner dictionary. And you need to find the name of the field\\n', \"that's of significance. Violation description\\n\", \"is what you want here. Let's see if I can\\n\", 'copy paste that. See. And the value corresponding\\n', 'to that is going to be the phrase search\\n', 'for food worker. So unlike match, match_phrase is going to look for\\n', 'the occurrence of this entire phrase within the VIOLATION DESCRIPTION\\n', 'field over here. So let me go ahead\\n', 'and run the cell. As you can see, you have a lot of results where you\\n', \"have the violation field, have the term, food worker here. Let's move on to\\n\", 'the last example, which is going to\\n', 'be multi_match, and multi_match is\\n', 'going to enable us to find matches using\\n', \"multiple different fields. For instance, let's\\n\", 'say that we want to find all the\\n', 'restaurants that have pizza or pasta in either their name or\\n', 'CUISINE DESCRIPTION. Looks like a standard\\n', \"search query. Let's say that you're craving\\n\", 'Italian food and you want to make sure that you want to\\n', \"either have pizza or pasta, excepting that we're working\\n\", \"with an inspections dataset. Let's imagine that this is a\\n\", 'regular restaurant dataset instead of an inspection\\n', \"dataset just for this question. So I'm going to say\\n\", 'client.search, open parentheses, close parenthesis,\\n', \"index = nyc_index, and body equal to, let's just capture the\\n\", 'response object instance into a variable\\n', 'called response here. Let me start typing the query. Once again, the field that you begin with\\n', 'is going to be query, and the value is going\\n', 'to be a dictionary. Instead of match\\n', \"or match_phrase, you're going to say multi_match. And then the corresponding value here is going to be\\n\", 'another dictionary. And within that\\n', 'inner dictionary, you need to specify, one more query field. And the query field here\\n', 'is going to simply be a combination of both\\n', 'the pizza and pasta. As you can see, I have\\n', \"a misspelling here. I'll try to fix that. Pizza and the pasta, and that's going to\\n\", \"be your query fields. That's not the only thing\\n\", 'that you need to mention. You need to also mention\\n', 'a list of fields inside which you want to\\n', \"look for these search terms. So that's going to be the\\n\", 'next field value pair. The field here is\\n', 'going to be fields, and the value here is going\\n', \"to be a list of fields, and let's say DBA\\n\", 'is the first one. And the second one is going\\n', 'to be CUISINE DESCRIPTION. I am going to copy paste that from my source JSON file\\n', 'so as to not make a typo. CUISINE DESCRIPTION,\\n', \"that's going to be the second\\n\", 'field value pair, and You can also mention, what scoring that you want to apply by mentioning the\\n', 'field name as type, and the corresponding\\n', 'value is going to be having the values\\n', 'as most fields here, which would indicate that\\n', 'the scoring will be based on the match happening\\n', 'in both of the fields. So accordingly, the search\\n', 'results will be scored. By the ranking algorithm. So let me go ahead\\n', 'and run the cell, as you can see. Only one of the results\\n', 'have matching pasta, phrase in it, but other\\n', \"ones are about pizza. That'll be it for\\n\", \"today's lecture. I'll see all of\\n\", 'you on Wednesday.']\n",

            "['polymorphic data structures. So another thing that I\\n', 'want to mention here, the document in the document database structure\\n', 'is going to be very closely associated\\n', 'with what we all know as object in object\\n', \"oriented programming. It'll have very\\n\", 'similar structure. Hence, the flexibility\\n', 'with respect to being able to define it\\n', \"however you want it to. Now, let's take a look at an example of a\\n\", 'document database. So documents are\\n', 'stored in the form of structures which are\\n', \"very similar to JSON. I'll tell you why\\n\", \"I'm saying very similar to JSON shortly. So you're going to have the fields represented\\n\", 'using key value pairs, and then you can have individual structures\\n', 'of dictionaries within your original\\n', 'document itself. You could also have arrays\\n', \"and things like that. And we'll dive into\\n\", \"the format shortly. Let's talk about\\n\", \"exactly what is meant by document model in MongoDB. So first of all, the document model is going to offer you four key features. The first one, it's going to\\n\", 'give you a really good API, which you can leverage\\n', 'to be able to query your data in order to be able to answer\\n', 'all of your questions, somewhat similar to SQL, but not exactly like SQL, because SQL requires you\\n', 'to have structured data, whereas MongoDB supports\\n', \"semi structured data. So you're going to use API, which stands for application\\n\", \"programming interface to be able to query information. From your MongoDB documents, and you're going to shortly learn what's meant by\\n\", \"the term collections. We'll come to that in\\n\", 'a couple of slides. So the second key\\n', 'feature is that, uh, your data can be stored in a distributed manner while being resilient to all\\n', 'potential failures. So that is MongoDB allows you to perform\\n', \"horizontal scaling. Last lecture, we discuss what's meant by\\n\", 'horizontal scaling. When you add more and\\n', \"more computing machines to form a cluster. That's when you are performing\\n\", 'horizontal scaling. So even though the focus\\n', 'of project P4 is going to be about running MongoDB within a single\\n', 'Docker container, I want all of you to know\\n', 'that it is possible for you to come up with a cluster\\n', 'of Docker containers, using Docker compost\\n', 'and actually distribute your data in\\n', \"between your cluster nodes. That's an option. So\\n\", \"that's the second feature. The third feature is\\n\", \"schema flexibility, which we've already spoken\\n\", \"about for a couple of minutes. So I'm just going to move\\n\", 'on to the fourth feature, which is nothing\\n', 'but object mapping. So these features three and four are very\\n', \"closely tied up. The cause of the flexibility in your schema is why you're able to have flexibility\\n\", 'with respect to object mapping and simplicity with\\n', \"respect to object mapping. You're going to\\n\", 'be able to easily mention the\\n', 'relationships between your entities within the data, even though it is\\n', \"semi structured. Now, let's focus on the document part of\\n\", 'the document model. So here is an example\\n', 'where you have a JSON that represents\\n', \"user details. For instance, some form of automated generated ID, clearly, nobody's going to\\n\", 'type in this ID, auto generated ID,\\n', 'and then you have, like a different user\\n', 'ID for that user. And age for the user, the status of the\\n', 'user, and so on. And you also have a couple of accounts associated\\n', \"with the user. So let's dive into the\\n\", 'details with respect to the JSON format here in case you are not familiar\\n', 'with the JSON format. JSON, first of all stands for JavaScript object notation. The JSON format was\\n', 'developed to be very closely associated with\\n', \"the programming language. JavaScript, it's a very\\n\", 'simplistic format. You entire data collection. Sorry, let me not use\\n', 'the term collection. Your entire data within a document is going\\n', 'to be enclosed within a pair of curly braces that indicates the start and\\n', 'end of the document. And individual field value pairs are going to be\\n', 'separated by a colon. On the left you have the field, on the right you have the value. Each field must be\\n', 'enclosed within quotation mark if it\\n', 'is of strength type, and each field value pair is going to be\\n', 'separated by a comma, as are represented using open and closed\\n', 'square brackets and items within the arrays\\n', 'are represent sorry, are separated, once\\n', 'again, using commas. Any questions about the\\n', \"basics of JSON format? You're going to have to get used to this structure because\\n\", \"that's what we're going to be dealing with in project.p3 and also over\\n\", \"the next few lectures. Now, let's talk\\n\", 'about collections. So this is what one\\n', 'document looks like, what is meant by collections. So first of all, a document is a way for you to organize and store data in the form of field value pairs\\n', 'inside MongoDB. Collections is nothing but a collection of a bunch\\n', 'of those documents. And it is an organized\\n', 'way for you to store individual documents that are related to each other. Usually, by the occurrence of common fields in between\\n', 'those documents. That said, keep in mind that I told you that there\\n', \"is no strict schema. So I'll come back to\\n\", 'talking would do documents inside a collection need to\\n', \"have the exact same format. We'll answer that\\n\", 'question shortly. So the answer is definitely no, because we want to be able to support semi structured data. MongoDB does not\\n', 'enforce a single schema on a collection that is documents\\n', \"can have common fields, but they're not required to have those common\\n\", 'fields by default. For example, the\\n', 'document on the left over here does not have\\n', 'the country field. The document on the right\\n', 'has the country field, these two documents can be\\n', 'part of the same collection, hence the flexibility with\\n', 'respect to schema over here. That said, there could\\n', 'be common fields, for example, user ID, age, and status are common fields across these\\n', 'two documents over here. Now, do you always need to\\n', 'have that schema flexibility? Is there a way for\\n', 'you to enforce a schema within a\\n', 'particular collection? Yes, there is a way\\n', 'for you to enforce schema within a\\n', \"MongoDB collection. And you're going to do\\n\", 'so using JSON Schema. And this is going to\\n', 'allow you to specify a pre-described\\n', 'document structure to be configured on a\\n', \"poor collection basis, and that's how you\\n\", 'can enforce schema. But do people in general actually enforce\\n', \"schema? Not really. That's why they're\\n\", 'going to go with MongoDB for their data\\n', 'storage and analysis. But let me mention a couple\\n', 'of things about JSON Schema. The document validation here is going to allow\\n', 'restrictions to be made when new documents are added to that\\n', 'particular collection. It allows for things like for presence of a particular\\n', 'field type of a field even like individual values to be\\n', 'validated as part of this, JSON Schema\\n', 'verification process. So you have a lot of tunable factors with respect\\n', 'to schema validation. Administrators have a\\n', 'lot of flexibility. For instance, like if a particular document does not comply with a defined structure, it can either be rejected or it could still be written\\n', 'into the collection, while logging that\\n', 'exception information into some form of log that tracks all of those schema\\n', 'related details. So I just wanted to give you an overview that it is\\n', \"possible to enforce schema, but we're not going to focus on that particular\\n\", \"aspect of MongoDB. So let's move on to talking about data modeling with\\n\", 'respect to MongoDB. Why the flexibility with\\n', 'respect to the schema design. Here is the fundamental\\n', 'reason for it. The majority of the no SQL databases\\n', 'have this philosophy, where they think that\\n', 'the schema design should come from the need\\n', 'of the application itself. And you all and I know that application needs keep\\n', 'changing on a daily basis. So that would mean that you need flexibility with\\n', \"respect to being able to define your schema. So that's why majority of the semi structured\\n\", 'data gets processed using, no SQL databases, and\\n', \"people don't really put their effort to convert the\\n\", 'data into structured data. So the schema design\\n', 'is definitely defined or associated at\\n', 'the application level, and it will definitely change as and when the application\\n', \"is going to change. So let's talk about\\n\", 'the data modeling and the document model over here and what is the core\\n', 'of the data modeling. So the core here is\\n', 'to understand what data is going to be stored within your non\\n', 'relational database, and also what queries you want to be able to run\\n', 'on that particular data. And the design\\n', 'requirements obviously are going to be controlled by\\n', \"various other factors as well, but let's not focus on that. So the data model in MongoDB specifically\\n\", 'is document oriented. You store the data in\\n', \"the form of documents, and you have flexibility. That's because you can\\n\", 'combine any type of data, and you can leave out\\n', \"fields as long as you don't have JSON\\n\", 'Schema enforcement. And it is also dynamic. If you want, you can have a\\n', \"predefined schema structure, or your data doesn't have to\\n\", 'conform to any such things, so which means that you\\n', 'can have easy flexibility and dynamic control with respect to the data\\n', \"modeling itself. Now, let's talk about the factors that are\\n\", 'going to be important with respect to being able to support a MongoDB\\n', 'application development. So you have a lot of design\\n', 'possibilities with respect to the applications usage pattern because you have an\\n', 'evolving schema here. You can just very easily add\\n', 'or remove field value pairs, and then just keep going\\n', 'on with your analysis. And this does not\\n', 'require any downtime to your database itself, unlike\\n', \"relational databases, when you want to add a column, you're going to have to have a downtime because\\n\", \"you're actually changing the structure schema. So that would mean that MongoDB has a fair advantage\\n\", 'because of the flexibility. >> It enables you\\n', \"to keep improving your application performance as you're running the application. Let's talk about schema\\n\", 'design considerations here. I mentioned this on the fly. Your queries and your\\n', 'actual data are going to decide exactly what your\\n', 'individual application requires. A couple of things that\\n', 'you need to always know how exactly CRUD\\n', 'operations occur. So CRUD is a common\\n', \"acronym that you'll hear a lot when it comes to non relational databases and\\n\", 'even relational databases. What does CRUD refer to? C-R-U-D. C refers to create, R refers to read, U refers to update and\\n', \"what does D refer to? I'm blanking out. So basic of the CRUD operations, you have the read patterns\\n\", 'and write patterns. Those are going to\\n', 'control exactly how your schema needs\\n', 'to be designed, with respect to any database, either relational\\n', 'or non relational. After taking read and write\\n', \"patterns into consideration, you're probably going\\n\", 'to consider how exactly you want to be able to define\\n', \"relationships between data. And we'll talk about\\n\", 'two different kinds of defining relationships. One is linking, and\\n', 'another one is embedding. First of all, let me\\n', 'define what is embedding, and let me define\\n', 'what is linking. So embedding is going\\n', 'to be able to capture associated information inside a single\\n', 'document structure. On the left over here, you have an embedded document. For example, you have a blog\\n', 'post document over here, and all of the comments within a particular blog post are embedded into the\\n', \"exact same document, that's option number 1 for you. Option number 2 here is linking. You can have one document\\n\", 'represent the blog post, and a series of documents representing\\n', 'individual comments, and you can create a link\\n', 'in between the blog post and the link documents by\\n', 'using some form of ID field. For example, you can define blog_id field with an individual comments\\n', \"document over here. So we'll shortly talk about what are the advantages\\n\", 'of embedding over linking, which one do you have to\\n', 'go with with examples. Now, do I want all of the data information to be\\n', 'within the same document, that is, do I want\\n', 'it to be embedded? Or do I need to be able to just keep the\\n', 'individual document as thin as possible and only\\n', 'want to reference to the linked document as in\\n', 'then it is necessary for me. So these kind of\\n', 'questions are going to be critical for you to\\n', 'design the schema. It depends on how\\n', \"frequently you'll be accessing your embedded\\n\", 'or linked data. Also, you have privacy concerns. Is your embedded or linked data going to be public\\n', 'information or private, depending on access\\n', \"constraints with respect to the two different documents that we're talking about here? Now, here is another example which talks about combining\\n\", 'embedding with linking. Do you have to essentially have only embedded information or have only linked information? You can use a combination\\n', 'of both of those. For example, you have the\\n', 'movies document over here, which has embedded actors\\n', 'and financials information, but you have a linked\\n', 'information to the reviews associated with that particular individual\\n', \"movie document. It's acceptable\\n\", 'to do any kind of combination in between\\n', 'embedding and linking. Now, that directly brings us to talking about\\n', \"relationships. So it's a common\\n\", 'misconception that just because we are dealing with a non relational database here, there are no defined\\n', 'relationships. In fact, relationships are\\n', 'how exactly you will control the schema enforcement\\n', 'versus lack of schema enforcement\\n', 'with respect to being able to store your\\n', 'semi-structured data. And you have three options with respect to defining\\n', 'relationships. You can have one-to-one\\n', 'relationship, one-to-many relationship, and\\n', \"many-to-many relationship. And we're going to spend\\n\", 'a couple of minutes talking about each category\\n', 'along with an example so that we can understand the\\n', 'differences and as to how exactly you want to be able\\n', 'to pick one for your schema. So first of all, one-to-one relationship\\n', 'is represented and stored within a single document\\n', 'as one might guess. This would typically\\n', 'be information like additional details\\n', 'associated with a customer, for instance, within\\n', 'the customer table, you have your customer\\n', 'name and customer ID. Here are some other\\n', \"example scenario. Let's say that you\\n\", 'want to be able to map a patron and the\\n', \"address relationships. Then you'll probably\\n\", 'want to have a singular view of the data entity in the\\n', 'context of each other so that you are able to have\\n', 'a one on one relationship between the map patron and\\n', \"the associated addresses. So that's another\\n\", 'example scenario for one-to-one relationship. So all of the fields that have one-to-one\\n', 'relationship with each other are going\\n', \"to be contained within a single document. So embedded way is going to be the way for you to store a one-to-one relationship. Let's talk about\\n\", 'one-to-many relationship, otherwise, 1-N relationship. one-to-many relationship\\n', 'can be considered when a particular entity of a given type is associated with N objects of some\\n', 'other second type. For example, we saw the\\n', 'customers document, which had one on\\n', 'one relationship between the customer name\\n', 'and the customer ID. You take that one\\n', 'and say that now the customers are going to be\\n', \"buying a bunch of products. So typically, you'd want\\n\", 'to store the invoices in a different document\\n', 'as a linked document as opposed to cluttering\\n', 'the customers document. Because, when you want to\\n', \"retrieve customer data, you're probably not going\\n\", 'to always retrieve all of the invoice information that is associated with a customer. So access pattern, read pattern considerations are going to determine whether this data needs to be\\n', 'linked or embedded. This case, you have\\n', 'the information stored as a link document. So in the invoices document, you have a bunch of things. Why is this one-to-many\\n', 'relationship? Clearly, a customer is not\\n', 'going to buy a single product, so that would mean\\n', 'that a customer is going to have more\\n', 'than one invoice, hence, one-to-many\\n', 'relationship over here. So when it comes to\\n', 'one-to-many relationship, unlike one-to-one,\\n', 'you have a choice. You can either embed the\\n', 'relationship or link it. So let me give you an example\\n', \"scenario for both of those. Let's talk about linking\\n\", 'scenario over here. Suppose you wanted to create\\n', 'a relationship between a publisher and the books\\n', 'that they have published. Suppose you had the\\n', 'same publisher data for a different book. Sorry, this should\\n', 'say a different book. If you have same\\n', 'publisher information for a different book, and both of those books were\\n', \"authored by the same author, let's say that you would\\n\", 'want to be able to embed the publisher document\\n', 'inside the document. Embedding the publisher\\n', 'information inside the book document would\\n', \"make it complicated because you'll probably\\n\", 'want to separate individual book information from the associated publisher, whether or not they are\\n', 'the same publishers. It would make sense for you to take the publisher information and put it in a linked document\\n', 'instead of embedding it. Another example\\n', 'scenario which talks about embedded\\n', 'one-to-many relationship, map a patron with multiple\\n', \"address relationships. Possibly, you'd want to\\n\", 'embed that information, because other than just\\n', 'the address information, unlike a publisher, which can publish a document, which can have multiple\\n', 'other information, your address\\n', 'relationship document will probably only\\n', 'have the address. Again, it depends on\\n', \"individual use case scenarios. Let's talk about the last\\n\", 'option for relationships, which is many-to-many\\n', 'relationship. Many-to-many relationship\\n', 'exists between two entities where you have multiple possible options to be able to connect\\n', \"one versus the other. So, for example, let's say that you have products\\n\", \"document over here, you're going to have a many-to-many\\n\", 'relationship between the invoices and the\\n', 'products document because each invoice\\n', 'probably is going to be associated with\\n', \"more than one product and you're going to see one product in\\n\", 'more than one invoice, hence, the many-to-many\\n', 'relationship over here. So, again, I have another\\n', 'example scenario, a book was written\\n', 'by multiple authors. And similarly, one of the authors has written\\n', 'multiple books that would be a really good example of\\n', \"many-to-many relationship. Possibly, you're going to be\\n\", 'choosing link documents for many-to-many relationship\\n', 'as opposed to giving preference to\\n', 'embedded documents. So key things for you\\n', 'to consider when it comes to the choice of do\\n', 'you embed or do you link. Well, it depends on what kind of factors that\\n', 'control your decisions here. In order to help you out with the choice of your relationship, you can consider a\\n', \"few things here. If you're worried about the integrity of your\\n\", 'read operations, then you can embed all of\\n', 'your information together. As opposed to that, when you have a link option, you can have huge\\n', \"number of relationships that don't have to be collapsed\\n\", 'into a single document. And also with respect to\\n', \"integrity of write operations, you're possibly going to prefer embedded documents as well, as opposed to the\\n\", 'link documents. So any scenario where you want the data to be dealt\\n', 'together as a single unit, even though it is\\n', \"associated data, you're probably going to put that as embedded information. Also, when a particular\\n\", 'part of your data is more frequently used as opposed to the remaining\\n', \"part of your data, you're probably going to link the information as\\n\", 'opposed to embed. So just like how you have ACID support for\\n', 'relational databases, you have ACID support for non relational\\n', 'databases as well. This slide just gives\\n', 'you a quick review of each of the four\\n', \"ACID principles. I'm not going to go over those. Again, it's just provided\\n\", 'to you for your perusal. Any questions on\\n', 'the theory behind document databases before\\n', \"we move on to a demo? Now, before we do the demo, let's do Top Hat. Let's give it a\\n\", 'shot one more time. Hopefully this time,\\n', \"second time will be jam. Are people still having issues? Good. Let's give this a shot. Again, if you were not here at the beginning\\n\", 'of the lecture, I want to definitely\\n', 'reiterate this, please answer the\\n', \"question honestly. I'm not going to be looking\\n\", 'at individual answers. Top Hat forced me to\\n', 'enter a correct answer, but there are no\\n', 'correctness points. So hopefully all of\\n', 'you should see one if you responded\\n', \"to the question. Twenty-five. That makes me feel concerned. [LAUGHTER] Let's\\n\", 'put it this way. If you honestly thought\\n', 'that it took you more than 15 hours to\\n', 'finish Project P2, please come talk\\n', 'to me if you want to be able to speed yourself up. I was honestly hoping\\n', 'to find answers in the ballpark of\\n', 'somewhere between 6-10, and majority of you\\n', \"have mentioned 6-10. That's great. So\\n\", 'speaking about Project, Project 3 has been out there\\n', 'for a couple of days now. Hopefully, at least\\n', 'some of you got a chance to take a\\n', \"look at Project 3. Unlike Project 2, Project 3 is probably going to be taking lesser time for you, mainly because you're going\\n\", \"to be using MongoDB API, and it's relatively easier to be able to solve\\n\", 'the easy questions using MongoDB API than by using subqueries in SQL\\n', \"to be able to answer them. That's it. You have 34\\n\", \"questions for Project P3. So please get started early and don't let it surprise you. So we're going to go through\\n\", 'some of the setup steps now. So hopefully that should enable all of you to get\\n', 'started with things. Speaking of the setup, I have the setup\\n', \"for today's lecture updated in lecture\\n\", 'snippets MD file, which is in the main page\\n', 'of the f24 repository. And if you go into the\\n', \"lecture directory, you have the dataset files. I've tried to mimic what Sachy\\n\", 'has done with Project P3. IMDb dataset was formatted, similar to how Ricky\\n', 'formatted it for Project P2. And I have formatted\\n', 'the lecture dataset to be similar to what you\\n', 'have to do in Project P3. Hopefully, that\\n', 'will come in handy. I have the notebook file and the template notebook\\n', \"file for today's lecture, so let's get started with\\n\", 'the setup part over here. You have a bunch\\n', 'of installations that you need to go through. Some of the would have\\n', 'probably already completed, hopefully, Jupyter and Pandas. Sachy he has a different\\n', 'autograder for P3. Unlike P2, she has asked you to keep checking\\n', 'in your notebook file, and the autograder is\\n', 'going to automatically be executed from GitHub classroom. So you have a couple of more modules to install to\\n', 'be able to support that. And you have a couple\\n', 'of Python modules, PyMongo, to be able to\\n', \"actually use MongoDB API. And you're going to be working with GeoPandas because\\n\", 'you are going to create geographic\\n', 'visualizations and MATLAB for the regular\\n', 'visualizations. So these are the\\n', \"installation requirements. I've given you the docker\\n\", \"clean up part again. If you haven't\\n\", \"already cleaned up your MySQL Docker container, please make sure to do so. I don't want you to\\n\", 'run out of memory. So this time, we are going to be using the MongoDB Docker image. Give me a second. Let me switch over here\\n', \"and let's do this. >> I just need to zoom in so\\n\", \"that you all can see this. So we're going to do a docker\\n\", 'pull of the MongoDB image, Docker pull Mongo, and you can just check the Docker image by executing\\n', 'the Docker images command. Quick reminder, please\\n', 'delete the MySQL image. Even the image is going\\n', \"to take up disk space, so when you don't need it, please get rid of that. Mongo image is going to\\n\", \"be the one that you'll be working with for project p4. I have also given you\\n\", 'the Docker run command. Let me copy paste the\\n', \"Docker run command, and I'm going to be\\n\", 'talking about that. Recall that, when we configured\\n', 'the Docker container for the container that\\n', 'was running MySQL server, we configured port 3306 because that is the\\n', 'default port number, which is used by MySQL server\\n', 'to listen to the traffic. So the default pot number\\n', \"that's going to be used by your MongoDB\\n\", 'application is 27017. So the port mapping\\n', 'is now going to have -p option as your\\n', 'local host IP address, which is 127.0.0.1 to\\n', \"represent your VM IP address. And then I'm picking the\\n\", 'exact same port number to map from my VM to\\n', 'the Docker container, 27017, you can change\\n', \"this if you want to. And then the destination port definitely needs to be 27017. If you want to control that, you're going to have\\n\", 'to install MongoDB on Ubuntu container and start that using a\\n', \"different port number. Since we're not\\n\", \"going to do that, and we're going to use\\n\", \"the MongoDB base image, let me go ahead and change the name of the container here. And I'm just going\\n\", 'to say mongodb_demo, and if I do docker ps -a, I should be able to see\\n', 'a running container. Any questions on the set up as simple as what\\n', 'you did for MySQL? Hopefully, by now,\\n', 'all of you should be very comfortable using\\n', \"Docker commands. So what I'm going to do\\n\", 'now is clear my screen and establish another SSH session and launch Jupyter notebook. Just give me one second to\\n', \"do the directory navigation. So I'm going to launch Jupyter notebook just by\\n\", \"typing Jupyter space notebook. Final piece of the puzzle, I need my tunnel. I'm going to put 8,000 on my laptop to put 8888\\n\", 'on my virtual machine, and once I do that, I should be able to access\\n', \"my notebook from my laptop. So let me type in 8,000 here. Let's get started with\\n\", 'the import statements. Just like how we use the OS module to process\\n', \"multiple CSV files, we're going to be using\\n\", 'the OS module to process multiple json files\\n', \"for project p4. So I'm going to\\n\", 'import the OS module, and from the pymongo module, I am going to\\n', 'import MongoClient, which is going to enable us to establish connection to\\n', \"our MongoDB database. I am also going to import BSON, I'll shortly talk about\\n\", \"what is meant by BSON. For now, let's just go\\n\", \"ahead and do the import. Let's first establish\\n\", 'a connection here. I need to invoke MongoClient from inside\\n', 'the pymongo module, and I need to specify the\\n', \"details of the connection here. So that's going to\\n\", 'be MongoDB: and then my local host to represent the local host IP address or\\n', 'the local host terminology, both of those can be\\n', 'interchangeably used. And I need to mention the\\n', \"port number, which is 27017. That's going to be the\\n\", 'details that you need to mention in order to be able\\n', 'to establish a connection. Two MongoDB database, which is running inside your\\n', \"Docker container, we're able to directly mention localhost:27017 because\\n\", 'of the -p mapping then we launched the\\n', 'Docker container. I mapped port 27017 from inside my VM to the exact same port\\n', 'inside my Docker container. Let me store the\\n', 'client object instance into a variable called client. So the very first method that\\n', \"I'm going to show you is to invoke something\\n\", 'called a server_info using the client\\n', \"object instance. So I'm going to have to\\n\", 'type client.server_info, and this is a method so open parentheses\\n', 'close parentheses. This will give you\\n', 'the version details about your MongoDB server. So your MongoDB version is 8.0, and then you have a bunch\\n', 'of other details as well, OpenSSL information and all\\n', 'the associated information with respect to the\\n', \"MongoDB installation. Now, let's talk about\\n\", \"MongoDB sample dataset. So I have a URL over here. During the lecture, I'm\\n\", 'going to be using example JSON files from the\\n', 'sample training data set. So each of the sample data sets contains a collection\\n', 'of documents. So the collection\\n', 'of the documents are specified underneath, if you scroll down. For example, the sample\\n', 'training database contains these collections. So specifically for\\n', \"today's lecture, I'm going to focus on the\\n\", 'inspection collection and the trips collection. For instance, let\\n', 'me click on trips. You could also scroll down. So if you click\\n', 'on the hyperlink, that will give you\\n', 'a sample document. So it says sample\\n', 'document because not all of the documents need to follow the exact same structure. There could be other\\n', 'documents within the collection which have\\n', 'different key value pairs. So the sample document\\n', 'is going to enable you to get familiarized\\n', 'with the structure. So you can do this with the\\n', \"project P3 data set as well. You've been asked to work with sample_mflix data set with sams for movie\\n\", 'collection data set. You can just use this\\n', 'link to get yourself familiarized with the\\n', 'individual collections by going through the sample\\n', 'documents before you start answering the questions\\n', 'in project P3. Any questions at all\\n', 'about how to access the sample documents associated with each of the data sets? Now, the very first thing\\n', \"that you're going to do, is to be able to\\n\", \"create a database with the client object instance. So you're going to\\n\", 'have to say client. and then followed by which\\n', \"you're going to have to specify a database name. Let me create the\\n\", 'database name as sample_training and\\n', \"I'm going to capture the database object instance\\n\", 'reference into a variable, and let me use DB to represent\\n', 'the database over here. So what will happen now is, has the database gotten created? Not really. MongoDB follows what is referred to\\n', 'as lazy creation. What is meant by lazy creation? When you create a\\n', 'brand new database, you are actually only creating a reference and actually not physically creating a database\\n', 'on your MongoDB database. What do I mean by only\\n', 'creating a reference? Unless you perform a\\n', 'write operation, that is, by inserting a document into one of the collections\\n', \"inside your database, the database actually isn't\\n\", \"going to physically exist, hence the name lazy creation. It's going to just wait\\n\", 'up until you actually create the data to be able\\n', 'to create the database. Now, let me talk about\\n', \"the data structure here. It's going to be\\n\", 'similar to what you need to do with the P3. When you clone the GitHub\\n', \"private classroom repository, you're going to automatically have your data set in there. Is going to be contained\\n\", 'in a similar folder. So I have the\\n', 'sample_training folder, which contains the trips and\\n', 'the inspections data set, trips.json and then\\n', \"inspections.json. We're going to now load both of those data sets into\\n\", 'the MongoDB database, which we just now\\n', 'created by saying, client.sample_training. So the code in the next cell\\n', \"should look very familiar. Hopefully, y'all wrote code similar to this for project P2. I wrote this code when we were processing the IMDB CSV files, except that instead of\\n\", \"processing CSV files, now we're going to\\n\", 'process json files. The only difference between the prior version of this\\n', \"code and this version is that I'm invoking listdir function by passing a directory\\n\", 'as an argument. Because the files are\\n', 'inside a directory, I need to specify the directory over\\n', \"here as an argument, and I'm retrieving\\n\", 'all the json files, replacing the.json to be able\\n', 'to create collection names, just like how we created\\n', 'table names with the CSV file names or\\n', 'the TSV file names for Project P2 and\\n', 'the lecture examples. Any questions at all about the lines of code\\n', \"within the cell? I'm going to move on\\n\", 'to the next cell. Once again, using enumerate\\n', \"to ensure that I'm getting both the ID and the\\n\", 'name of the file, when I iterate over\\n', 'my json files list, because I need to be able\\n', 'to use this index to index into the collections\\n', 'list over here. So the very first thing\\n', 'that you need to do here is to up the\\n', 'individual json files. So let me use width so as to open and handle the close\\n', \"of the file together. So I'm going to say width open, and I need to specify the\\n\", \"name of the json file here, we'll come back to that later, and I'm going to open the\\n\", \"file using read mode. So I'm going to mention\\n\", 'rs the second option, and then let me use the file object reference\\n', 'variable as f here. So in order to mention the name, is it just sufficient for\\n', 'us to say json_ file here. Probably not, because,\\n', 'the json files are inside this\\n', 'sample_training directory. So instead of hard coding how\\n', \"exactly I define the path, by literally saying json_dir+ and then saying forward slash. Let's make it\\n\", \"platform independent. So I'm going to\\n\", 'achieve this by using os.pub.join function\\n', \"instead of hard coding. The type of slash here, I'm going to use a comma to mention both of\\n\", \"those arguments. And I'm going to\\n\", 'say os.path.join and let me mention both\\n', 'of those arguments. The first argument is going\\n', 'to be the directory name, and the second argument\\n', 'is going to be name of the file over here. So what does os.path.join\\n', \"enable you to do? It'll automatically identify\\n\", \"the type of the OS. For instance, it'll\\n\", \"open for us Linux, so it'll add a forward\\n\", 'slash in between sample_training and the\\n', 'individual JSON files. So once I have the file open, I am going to need to load the JSON content over here\\n', \"into individual collections. So let me take a minute to talk about what is meant by BSON. Here is where you're actually\\n\", 'going to be using BSON. BSON stands for\\n', 'binary representation of the exact same format, hence BSON, binary\\n', 'object notation. JSON stands for JavaScript\\n', 'Object Notation, BSON stands for Binary\\n', 'Object Notation. Rather than storing your\\n', 'data in the text form, when it comes to json, MongoDB always stores\\n', 'the information using binary object notation, hence the requirement\\n', 'for us to import the bson module at the\\n', \"beginning of the notebook. So we're going to be using\\n\", 'the bson module to load the json content by\\n', \"saying bson.json_util, and I'm going to use\\n\", 'the load s function, which considers the\\n', \"entire documents data as one single string, and it's going to\\n\", 'read up the data. Actually, before I do that, I need to be able to actually iterate over the data by saying four line in f. Let me\\n', \"tab end in this space in, and I'm going to make\\n\", 'sure that I remove any unnecessary white spaces by invoking the strip method\\n', \"on the line object instance. So we're going to read the\\n\", 'individual lines using the loads function inside the BSON module and the\\n', 'json_tel submodule over here. And this is going\\n', 'to give your data, so let me capture the data\\n', 'into a variable called data. And how do you actually insert the data\\n', 'into your database? You need your database variable, which we stored into a\\n', \"variable called DB over here. And then once you're mentioning\\n\", 'the database variable, you also need to mention the collection within\\n', \"the database variable. You're going to\\n\", 'use list indexing as a way to specify\\n', 'your collection, DB open square bracket\\n', 'close square bracket, and I need to mention my\\n', 'collection name here. Where is my collection\\n', \"name going to come from? It's going to come from\\n\", 'my collection list, where we just stripped off the.json name from\\n', \"the JSON files. So I'm going to just index\\n\", 'into the collection list, using the exact same index by\\n', 'saying collections of IDX. So this will enable you to specify the collection\\n', 'within the database, and the method that you need\\n', 'to invoke is going to be the insert_1 method to insert\\n', 'one specific document, and the document is the one that we just read in\\n', \"the previous line, so that's going to be the\\n\", 'data variable over here. Any questions at all\\n', 'about how to load the data into the\\n', \"database collections? So it's going to take a while\\n\", 'for this code cell to run because the inspections\\n', \"collection is relatively large. So it's going to\\n\", 'take fairly long for us to be able to load all of the documents\\n', 'into the collection. Meanwhile, any questions? So while that is running, I am going to open up the documentation for\\n', 'the find APA function, which is going to\\n', \"be the very first. Oh, wait, we're at the 210 mark. My apologies. So I'll wrap it up by quickly\\n\", 'mentioning one thing. So if you want to get\\n', 'started with the project, I have a few queries\\n', \"which I've already answered as part of the completed version\\n\", \"of the notebook file.

Last lecture, we were cut off in the middle when we\\n', 'were talking about the four categories of\\n', 'non relational databases. Quick recap, the first\\n', 'three categories that we discussed are key\\n', 'value databases, graph databases, and\\n', \"column databases. Let's move on to the last one, which is clearly of\\n\", \"significance for MongoDB. So we're going to\\n\", 'take that option 4 as the very last one so\\n', 'that we can build upon that. So MongoDB is an example of a type of no SQL database\\n', 'or non relational database, which is known as\\n', 'document database. The structure of the\\n', 'data is meant to provide support definitely\\n', 'for polymorphic data models. Again, review of what\\n', 'exactly do I mean by that, you need to be able to have your data in a semi\\n', 'structured format, unlike your relational databases which have a strict schema. So your data is going to be contained within what\\n', 'are called as documents, and each document contains\\n', 'some markup language that will enable you to identify field value pairs\\n', 'within the document. It might look similar\\n', \"to key value database, but you're going to see\\n\", 'a difference once I show you an example\\n', 'of a document. So what are the strengths of creating a\\n', 'non-relational database, which can support document type? Well, it is very easy for you to embed relationships into\\n', 'data structures like arrays, into mappings in the form of, like establishing linked\\n', 'relationship between documents? The mapping itself is not\\n', 'going to look complex, even though the\\n', 'document database allows you to have\\n']\n",

Now, you're going to\\n\", 'have to go back to finding titles of\\n', 'all the movies that belong to the same genres\\n', \"as those in this category. So let's just assume just for the examples sake that we have more than one\\n\", \"category here, and I'm going to demonstrate the in operator\\n\", \"for you all here.

Recall from the\\n', 'previous lecture that your contained query should have all the explicit\\n', 'conditions typed out. That is, you need to say titleType = movie to make\\n', 'sure that you only filter out the movies that have the same\\n', 'genre as those belonging, to the genre from the movies with runtime greater\\n', \"than 150 minutes. Let's also display\\n\", 'the genre column so that you can take\\n', 'a look at that. If you want, you can display the title type as well to confirm that\\n', 'you only have movies. Any questions on the operator? Question. [BACKGROUND]\\n', 'Find the number of movies that have\\n', 'more than one genre. [BACKGROUND] Oh, you\\n', \"could do that, as well. That's true. There are other ways of solving\\n\", \"this question. I've just given you\\n\", 'the way that came to my mind when I thought of this question,\\n', \"but you're correct. You can do it that\\n\", 'way, too. You can quite literally use the in\\n', 'operator to solve this. Good question. Any other\\n', \"questions on the in operator? Let's move on to what question were we\\n\", \"solving? Question number 5. Let's move on to question\\n\", 'number 6, which is asking, find the title of\\n', 'the movies that have not received any ratings. Clearly, we need the opposite\\n', \"of the an operator here, which is the not an operator. We need to make sure to select any title that has no ratings. So I'm just displaying actually, instead of displaying tconst, let me display all\\n\", 'of the columns from title_ratings table. You have tconst and then you have the average\\n', 'ratings column. You have to find the titles of the movies that have not\\n', 'received any ratings at all. So now, you need to\\n', 'make sure to write this entire contained query from scratch because the operator\\n', \"here is going to be not in. There's not going\\n\", 'to be much point in testing the subquery here\\n', 'because the subquery quite literally is going\\n', 'to be all of the data from the title_ratings table. Just give me one\\n', \"second to be able to sync up my notes over here. So now, the inner subquery, we'll come back to that after we start typing the\\n\", 'contained query. This is the first\\n', \"example where I'm typing the contained\\n\", 'query from scratch, instead of testing\\n', \"the inner subquery. So I'm going to say\\n\", 'select primary title from title_basics table, and then there\\n', \"titleType = movie. For now, let's just have that. So that will give you\\n\", 'all of the movie titles. So other than primary title, you also have the tconst column, which gives you\\n', 'the identifier of the rows which represent movies. With this tconst, you can now match that with the tconst column of\\n', 'the title_ratings, table excepting that you\\n', 'want mismatch, not match. So other than saying\\n', \"titleType = movie, I'm going to include\\n\", 'an and clause and say tconst and not in, and then I need to\\n', 'mention my subquery here. My subquery here is\\n', 'going to be very simple, select tconst from\\n', \"title_ratings. That's where we want all of the title IDs from the\\n\", 'title_ratings table. So this will give you all\\n', 'of the titles that have zero ratings within the\\n', 'title_ratings table. And of course, you can select other relevant\\n', 'column information here to be able to answer the question in a better manner. Any questions about NOT IN\\n', \"before we move on to any and all examples. Next stop. Let's solve the, I believe the all question from\\n\", \"scratch and then I'll walk you through the\\n\", 'any question solution. Find all the titles that\\n', 'have an average rating greater than all the titles\\n', \"released in the year 2005. Let's solve the inner part\\n\", 'first, inner most part. So I need to say select\\n', \"star from title_basics. And I'm going to say, where startYear = 2005. Let's just select\\n\", 'all of the titles. The question is\\n', 'asking generically about all of the titles. So you need all of the titles that got released\\n', 'in the year 2005. So think about what is going to help you with respect to solving the rest\\n', \"of the question. Most of the times, it'll be the primary key or\\n\", 'foreign key on the table. In this case, tconst, I believe is the primary\\n', \"key of this table. So it's likely that you\\n\", 'would want to only select tconst and nothing else from\\n', 'this innermost subquery. Once you have all\\n', \"of the title IDs, let's now go back to the original question,\\n\", 'which is asking, find all the titles that have an average rating greater than all the titles released\\n', 'in the year 2005. This gives you all the title IDs for the movies released in 2005. Now, to get the average ratings, you need to go to the\\n', \"title ratings table, so that's going to be my\\n\", 'contained query here. Let me start typing\\n', \"the contained query. I'm going to say select tconst\\n\", 'then from title_ratings, and where the column\\n', 'name is average rating, greater than, and\\n', 'I need to mention, whatever is the required\\n', 'operator for the comparison, we want to be able to find\\n', 'all the titles that have rating greater than the average\\n', 'rating of all the titles, which means that you need\\n', 'to use the keyword all here to do the comparison. So let me tab in\\n', 'the inner query. That will give you\\n', 'title IDs of the movies that have average\\n', 'rating greater than the rating of the\\n', 'movies in 2005, to be able to extract\\n', 'the title information, you need to go back to\\n', 'the title basics table. So this question is an example of two levels of\\n', \"nested subqueries. You have two contained queries. So I'm going to say select\\n\", \"star from title_basics there, and I need to say tconst, and then in, this time it's going\\n\", 'to be the in operator, and let me tab in both the\\n', 'inner subqueries over here. Any questions about how to solve questions that involve\\n', 'more than one subquery? Let me walk you through\\n', 'any question here, which is find all\\n', 'the titles that have an average rating lower than any title released\\n', 'in the year 2005. I essentially wrote this\\n', 'question to build upon the previous question\\n', 'so that you know how to solve majority\\n', 'of the conference. So the innermost subquery is still going to be select\\n', 'tconst from title_basics, where start_year is 2005. Once you get that, you\\n', 'need to compute all of the average rating values for such movies in 2005 from\\n', \"the title_ratings table. That's going to be the second\\n\", 'level of nesting there. And then once you do that, you have the third\\n', 'level of nesting, which was similar to\\n', 'the previous question. Previously, we use the greater than operator with all operator. Now we need average\\n', 'rating lower than any of the titles\\n', 'released in 2005. So here, the comparison operator is going\\n', 'to be less than, and then the associated\\n', \"subquery operator is going to be any and then I'm sure the rest of the\\n\", 'query is self explanatory. Any questions at all about the four category of\\n', 'operators that we can use with multiple row\\n', 'single column subqueries? So, going back to the difference between noncorrelated and\\n', 'correlated subqueries, whenever your subquery does not have any relationship\\n', \"with your contained query, then you're actually writing\\n\", 'noncorrelated subqueries. All of the questions\\n', 'in project P2 that require subqueries will only need non correlated subqueries. I just wanted to show you an example of a\\n', 'correlated subquery. Given that we lost a\\n', 'lot of time rather than type the solution to\\n', 'this problem from scratch, let me walk you\\n', 'through the solution instead of typing the solution\\n', 'from scratch over here. So what is the\\n', 'difference between noncorrelated subqueries\\n', 'and correlated subqueries? When you have\\n', 'correlated subqueries, the subquery is going to depend on some information from\\n', \"the contained query. Let's solve a question that requires us to have\\n\", 'such a relationship. Find the titles of movies\\n', 'that have runtime longer than the average runtime of all the movies in\\n', 'the same genre. Now let me walk you through\\n', 'the inner query over here. This is a problem\\n', 'that you cannot solve by testing individual\\n', 'components of this query, unfortunately, because it\\n', 'is a correlated subquery. So your subquery over\\n', 'here is computing the average of the\\n', \"runtime minutes column from the title basics table. I'm essentially naming\\n\", 'the title basics table in the subquery as tb_inner. This is the syntax\\n', \"for naming a table, and we'll see that a lot using the join examples which are coming up after this question. So you can use any\\n\", \"descriptive name. I'm choosing to have\\n\", 'a proper name here by saying tb for title basics, and then underscore inner\\n', 'to denote that this is the inner version of the title_basics table\\n', 'and what do I want here? I want to be able to compute the average runtime for\\n', 'all of the titles where my subqueries genres\\n', 'column matches with my contained\\n', \"queries genres column. So that's why we are going to be using the table\\n\", 'naming to access the genre column to describe to my sequel which genre column\\n', \"we're referring to here, we are going to be using the\\n\", 'title_basics table twice, one in the outer\\n', 'contained query, one in the inner\\n', 'contained query. So tb.inner.genre should be exactly equivalent\\n', \"to tb.outer.genres. And then I'm also filtering\\n\", 'just the titles of movies. >> Once I do that, what do\\n', \"I want to be able to do? I've been able to compute the average runtime now I need\\n\", 'to be able to find all of the movies that have\\n', 'runtime longer than the average runtime of all of the movies in the\\n', 'exact same genre, hence the correlated query without this in the same genre, you will have a non\\n', 'correlated query to answer the rest\\n', 'of the question. So the correlation\\n', 'here being that the genre from the individual\\n', \"titles that you're doing the computations on\\n\", 'should match with the other titles within the same genre that\\n', \"is you're doing the computation\\n\", 'within each genre. So here, other than saying I want my title\\n', 'type to be movies, now I need to apply the condition where\\n', 'individual titles, runtime minutes should\\n', 'be greater than the average runtime\\n', 'minutes of all of the titles belonging\\n', \"to the same genre. A complicated question that's why we don't have correlated query based questions in project P2 so as to not make\\n\", 'it too complicated. Any questions at all about correlated subqueries versus\\n', \"non correlated subqueries. Let's move on to JOINs. JOINs are very simple and very easy for\\n\", \"you to understand. And I'm going to cover\\n\", 'three different types of JOINs with explicit\\n', 'examples that build on top of each other so as\\n', \"to make sure that you're able to understand the\\n\", 'differences very clearly. The most commonly used JOIN\\n', 'to combine information from multiple tables together\\n', 'is nothing but inner join, otherwise, also referred\\n', 'to as just join. In SQL if you just type JOIN, that always refers to inner\\n', \"join and not any outer join. Inner join is very simple. You're going to take two\\n\", \"different tables together, and you'll have primary\\n\", \"key on one table, foreign key on another table, and you'll literally apply\\n\", 'equality match between the primary key and the foreign key and\\n', 'only retrieve rows from the tables where you have matching primary versus\\n', 'foreign key mapping as simple as that. In order to solve the\\n', 'inner join question, which is asking you to find all the movies and the\\n', \"corresponding ratings, let's first go through the select star query\\n\", 'corresponding to the two tables. First rule of [inaudible] joins, identify the table names\\n', 'that have the information. So you need to find all\\n', 'the movie information and the corresponding ratings. So clearly you need the\\n', 'title_basics table, and then you are\\n', 'also going to need the title_ ratings\\n', 'table over here. So you have the primary key, tconst from title_basics table, and then you have the\\n', 'foreign key tconst from the title_ratings table. You are just going to write a JOIN clause to combine\\n', 'both of those together. Let me type select star FROM, and then you need to type one table within\\n', 'the FROM clause. Let me say title_basics\\n', 'over here, and you can just\\n', 'say title_basics and type\\n', 'title_basic.column name, or you can include an\\n', 'abbreviation like tb or b, for example, to make it shorter. Select star from title_basics, and going back over here, you want only the movie rows. So let me copy paste the\\n', \"WHERE clause over here. For now, let's just\\n\", 'execute this query. Select star from\\n', 'title_basic b where title type equal to movie. Now, instead of just\\n', 'selecting all of the data from the\\n', \"title_basic table, I'm now going to\\n\", \"perform an inner join, which I'm achieving\\n\", \"by typing just join. Join on what table? That's going to be\\n\", \"title_ratings table, and then you're going to have\\n\", 'to specify the ON clause. ON clause enables you\\n', 'to explicitly specify what the comparison\\n', 'relationship is. Let me use r as the\\n', \"naming for title ratings. I'm going to say b.tcnst\\n\", \"equal to r.tconst, that's going to be the\\n\", 'relationship that I apply. Now, notice one thing, your titlle_basics table\\n', 'contains 188 movies, and title_ratings table contains\\n', 'ratings for 389 titles, how many rows will we see\\n', \"if we do this inner join? Not alwas, you're\\n\", \"going to end up seeing exactly 188 rows. That's because there\\n\", \"are some titles which don't have ratings within\\n\", 'the title_ratings table. Inner join only returns\\n', 'the rows where you have exactly matching criteria\\n', 'for your ON clause, which would mean that\\n', 'only 95 rows have the matching tconst between the title_basics table\\n', 'and title_ratings table. Any questions on how\\n', \"inner join works. Now let's move on\\n\", \"to outer joins. I'm going to build upon the\\n\", 'same question to enable you to understand the two categories of outer join that I\\n', 'want you to learn, which is left outer join and\\n', 'then the right outer join. Just like how you can either\\n', 'say inner join or join. To be able to\\n', 'specify inner join, you can either say\\n', 'left join or left outer join to perform\\n', 'the left join. So what does the left join do? The left join is going to place the emphasis on the table\\n', 'within the FROM clause. So if the table within the\\n', 'from clause contains 188 rows, as in our example, your resultant table\\n', \"of the left join will contain exactly 188 rows. What's going to happen to the\\n\", \"rows where you don't have rating column information\\n\", \"from the second table, you're going to just have\\n\", 'a null column value there. So your outer join\\n', 'is going to enable you to maintain your\\n', 'original tables data, even though you\\n', \"don't have matching information from the table\\n\", \"that you're trying to join. Again, I have this\\n\", 'corresponding select query from the previous query, actually, let me go back\\n', \"to the previous query and we'll build upon the\\n\", 'previous query here. Instead of saying inner join, which will give me 95 rows, if I say left join, now that should\\n', 'give me 188 rows. And as you can see,\\n', 'if you scroll up, the average rating for some\\n', \"of those rows is empty, that's because you\\n\", \"don't have value for all such information within\\n\", 'the title_ratings table. Any questions on inner\\n', 'join versus outer join? Hopefully, all of you\\n', 'are clear on that. The other option for\\n', 'outer join, right join, what if you wanted to\\n', 'switch the ordering of the tables here instead of starting with\\n', 'title_basics table? What if you started with\\n', 'title_ratings table. You can answer the exact same\\n', 'question using right join. Let me paste the result\\n', 'from the previous query. Now instead of\\n', \"title basis b here, I'm going to say title_ ratings of r. Instead of left join, I now need to do right join, and of course, the other\\n\", 'table names should be title_ basics, and the order of this\\n', 'does not really matter, and you can just get the exact same result as the previous query if I had\\n', 'typed the correct thing, title basis b, that should be the correct one. Now, you can combine multiple joints together\\n', 'within a single query. I am just going to walk\\n', 'you through the solution for Q14 so that we can actually move on to talking about\\n', 'the order of execution, and maybe I can introduce\\n', 'Window function examples. So here is the key\\n', 'fundamental factor whenever you apply joins. The resultant set of rows\\n', 'will have random ordering. So you need to be extremely\\n', 'careful with that, which is what I was\\n', 'talking about at the beginning of\\n', \"today's lecture, the set of ordering, the fixes that I\\n\", 'made for Project P2, where for the questions\\n', \"where the ordering condition was either not sufficient enough or wasn't\\n\", 'mentioned at all. What do I mean by not\\n', \"sufficient enough? I'll show you an example of that with this particular query. Find all the movies, their average ratings\\n\", 'and the total number of regions that they have been released in three\\n', 'different tables, all of the movies, title_basics table, average\\n', 'rating, title_ratings table, number of regions they\\n', 'have been released, title_ akas table, identify the tables where your information is coming from. And majority of the P2 questions require you to just\\n', \"apply equality joins. I don't believe\\n\", 'anything actually has any other condition. So you just have to identify the corresponding\\n', 'relationship between the foreign key and\\n', 'the primary key, and then write the JOIN clauses. So now you have two\\n', 'different JOIN clauses. Does the order matter? Not really. You can choose\\n', 'to join in any way. You have three tables here. Any of those tables can be\\n', 'part of the FROM clause. Any of the three tables can be part of the\\n', 'first JOIN clause, and any of the tables\\n', 'can be part of the third JOIN clause.\\n', 'Does not matter. Any ordering will lead you to\\n', \"have the exact same result, assuming that you're\\n\", 'actually imposing ordering by using the\\n', 'ORDER BY clause over here. Now, you have a bunch of other things that we\\n', \"are doing over here. I'm having a GROUP BY clause where I'm grouping\\n\", 'the titles based on their title ID and also\\n', 'based on the average rating. Since I want to be\\n', 'able to display both the title name\\n', \"and the title ID, I'm also including\\n\", 'the title name, column within the\\n', \"GROUP BY clause, which is why I'm able to select\\n\", 'all of this information. Now we need the total number of regions that they have\\n', 'been released in, so I need to say count, and I need to count the\\n', \"distinct number of regions. Let's say that we want\\n\", 'unique number of regions and then that gives you\\n', 'the total calculation. Now, just for the\\n', \"sake of example, let me actually remove this entire ORDER BY clause over here and let's take\\n\", 'a look at the result. So your result is going\\n', \"to be randomly ordered. If you execute it one more time, that's going to give you\\n\", 'the exact same order. But then if I launch a\\n', 'new Docker container, you will not be guaranteed\\n', 'that I will get the exact same order\\n', 'as one of you will. So the only way to ensure\\n', 'that your result is properly ordered is by using\\n', \"appropriate ORDER BY clauses. So I'm going to\\n\", 'first impose ORDER BY restriction based on\\n', \"total regions column. Let's do descending order. Will that be sufficient enough? Maybe if you're ordering\\n\", \"based on a unique identifier, it'll probably be sufficient\\n\", \"enough, not always, though. In this case, you're ordering based on a total columns value. There could be matching\\n\", 'total columns value. You see a bunch of\\n', 'titles for which you have total regions to be\\n', 'exactly the same, which is one. So this is still not\\n', \"sufficient enough. So which means that you need to impose additional ordering. Let's impose two more ordering. I'm also going to order by the descending values\\n\", \"of the average rating. Will that be sufficient enough? I don't want to take chances. I'm also going to\\n\", 'make sure that I impose ordering of\\n', 'the third column, which is ascending order\\n', 'of the primary title. So this is precisely\\n', 'what I was trying to fix with some of\\n', 'the P2 questions that involve join during\\n', 'my office hours today. Any questions at all about join before I talk about where join fits into the\\n', 'order of execution? So we discuss the order of execution for the\\n', \"remaining clauses, excepting for join last lecture. I'm just going to plug\\n\", \"in join over here. Right after this, we'll\\n\", 'have top hat just giving you a heads\\n', 'up so that all of you can get ready for top hat.

The next question is asking, find the titles of\\n', 'the movies that have the maximum\\n', 'number of genres. So you have one more level of\\n', 'the problem to solve here.

You can either specify\\n', 'ascending order by ASC or do nothing because the default order is\\n', 'ascending order. Now, the third question also builds upon the first\\n', 'and the second question. Excepting that it is asking\\n', 'you to order the titles based on the descending\\n', 'alphabetical order instead of the ascending\\n', \"alphabetical order. Why don't you all take\\n\", 'a couple of minutes to go through this question? Make edits to your\\n', \"previous query and make sure that you're able to understand all\\n\", \"possible options with the order by clause. I'm going to get myself\\n\", \"set up for top hat. I haven't gotten a chance to\\n\", \"actually enter the question. Go ahead and try this question. I'll take a quick\\n\", '30 seconds break. Hopefully, I hope\\n', 'you got a chance to discuss the result\\n', 'of this query. You just need to change\\n', 'the second column ordering to descending ordering instead\\n', 'of ascending ordering. Unlike ascending ordering,\\n', 'descending ordering needs to be explicitly mentioned\\n', 'using the keyword DESC. Any questions at\\n', 'all about order by before we move on\\n', \"to group by clause? So I'm going to do something\\n\", 'with the group by clause. Before telling you\\n', 'what are all the rules or rule of thumbs associated\\n', \"with group by clause? I'm going to actually\\n\", \"show you the examples, and then we'll talk about the roles so that\\n\", \"it's easy for you to grasp the roles because we've\\n\", \"already seen an example. That's denoting that\\n\", 'particular role. First question. How many movies\\n', 'were released every year. So first of all, you need to identify the\\n', 'relevant columns. So let me do select star from\\n', 'title_basics, every year. So that would mean\\n', 'that start year column is of relevance for you. The question is asking\\n', \"you how many movies. So clearly, you've been asked to do account aggregate function. Let me rename the column\\n\", 'as movie count over here. What will this query give you? This query gives\\n', 'you some answer. What is this query answering? Can somebody volunteer\\n', 'and tell me? >> The rows are. >> How many rows are there\\n', 'in the title_ basics, or rather, how many\\n', 'titles are there? Not how many titles\\n', 'were released every year or to be\\n', 'even more specific. Definitely not about movies. So this query gives you the total aggregate\\n', 'value on all of the rows within your\\n', 'database table. What if we wanted to perform grouping before we do\\n', \"the aggregation part? That's where the GROUP BY clause is going to come into picture. Before that, I don't need\\n\", 'a were class here, right, because we are only\\n', 'interested in movies. I need to type my\\n', 'where clause in, WHERE titleType = movie. And then, me a second, I want to go back to my\\n', 'notes here really quickly. What should the\\n', 'GROUP BY clause be? So you need to mention\\n', \"a column name here. You're trying to group the\\n\", 'number of rows that have the exact same unique value corresponding to\\n', 'the starter column. Just give me one second. I am going to do the select star query one more time so that we can\\n', 'have that output here. So grouping is going to focus\\n', \"on one or more columns. Let's start with one column. The intent here is to group the rows based on\\n\", \"the starter column. You're going to consider\\n\", 'every unique value for that particular column, generate one group of rows corresponding to that\\n', \"particular unique value. That's the intent of the\\n\", 'basic GROUP BY clause. GROUP BY is going to\\n', 'be followed by what is the name of the\\n', \"column by which you want to do the grouping by this example. Give me a second. In this example, that's going to be the Start year column. So let's go ahead and\\n\", \"execute the query now. That gives you the movie count, corresponding to every year. That's hard for you to read the result of that\\n\", \"particular query because you don't really have the year corresponding to that\\n\", 'particular count. So other than selecting\\n', \"the aggregate here, I'm also going to\\n\", 'select startYear so that you can take a look\\n', 'at the number of movies. That particular year has. Now, going back to\\n', 'the previous query, can I select some\\n', 'other random column within my select clause, which is associated with a query that has a\\n', \"group by clause? Let's go ahead and try this. What if I select a primary\\n\", \"title along with this? So we are getting some results. Remember this, the first one, actually, give me a second. I'm looking at the\\n\", \"wrong output here. So that's what I thought. We would get an error in my SQL. My bad. That threw\\n\", 'me off completely. If you scroll down, you can see the error, select list not in group by clause and contains a\\n', 'non aggregated column, which is not functionally dependent on the\\n', 'group by clause. What exactly does\\n', \"this error mean? Now, Before we did the grouping, you had all of the rows of data. Once you do the grouping, you're collapsing the data associated with that\\n\", 'unique value from that particular grouping column\\n', 'into a single data point. So if you do that, when you\\n', 'have non-group by columns, like primary title and original title within\\n', \"your select clause, that doesn't really\\n\", 'make any sense. How will you select\\n', 'one primary title, then your resultant\\n', 'queries row indicates multiple titles that\\n', 'belong to all of the movies that got released in that\\n', 'particular unique year. So it does not make\\n', 'any sense for you to include any other columns within the select Clause that involves an associated\\n', 'group by clause. So the rule of thumb here, whenever your query\\n', 'has a GROUP BY clause, your select clause can contain\\n', 'one out of the two things. One, it can contain whatever column name you did the grouping by,\\n', 'which is start here. And two, it can\\n', 'contain any form of aggregate function that\\n', \"you're trying to compute on that collapsed group of rows corresponding to that\\n\", \"particular unique value of the column, in this case, that's\\n\", 'going to be start hear. Any questions on the rule\\n', 'of thumb with respect to select clause associated\\n', 'with the group by clause. >> Now, what is the\\n', \"average run time of movies for each release here? I'm going to let you\\n\", \"try this query out. I've already given\\n\", \"you the result query. I'm going to move on from Question 5 and move on\\n\", 'over to Question number 6 because Question 5 is very\\n', 'similar to Question 4. So Question 6, how\\n', 'many people were born in each birth year? So clearly we need different\\n', 'table information here? Can somebody look up and tell me what table name I\\n', 'need to type in here? You guys got this. Come on. Somebody look it up and tell me what table name I\\n', \"need to type in here. Let's have you go back to the previous lectures notebook file, and somebody answered\\n\", 'me this question. What should be the name of the table here? Yes. >> Name _basics. >> Name_basics. Thank you. So this is why it is\\n', 'very important that you have the select\\n', 'star from table name, Limit five query result\\n', \"when you solve Project P2. At some point, you're\\n\", 'going to be like, where is this data coming\\n', 'from? I have no idea. At that point, go back to those initial select queries\\n', 'and find the results. So select star from name_basics, how many people were\\n', 'born in each birth year. As you can see, birth year\\n', 'does contain null values. So you need to be a little bit\\n', 'cautious when it comes to, like, writing queries that\\n', 'have grouped by clauses. Dependent on columns\\n', \"that have null values. I'll show you shortly\\n\", \"why that is the case. Let's just go ahead and\\n\", 'answer this question without requiring any other\\n', 'additional input here. How many people were\\n', \"born in each year? So I'm going to say select\\n\", 'count of star as people count from name_basics, and let me just do\\n', 'group by birth year. Let me also select birth\\n', 'here so that we can see what corresponds to\\n', 'each of those counts. From zero is weird. The group by clause is counting\\n', 'all of the null values, putting those together\\n', 'into grouping. The group by clause does that. So when we actually use aggregate functions\\n', \"on regular queries, that don't involve group i Those functions actually make sure to ignore the null values, and they do the calculation for you by ignoring the null values. Otherwise, if you try to\\n\", 'find the average run prime, for instance, average of the\\n', \"average run prime column, you'll probably end\\n\", 'up with a null value. If one of those\\n', 'values is being null, then that might throw\\n', 'off your computation. It depends on individual\\n', 'application scenario. Aggregate functions\\n', 'ignore the null values in general when you apply them, but not when you have\\n', 'a group by clause, which means that if you want group by to ignore\\n', 'the null values, you need to explicitly use a WHERE clause to indicate that. So which means that I need\\n', 'to type a WHERE clause here, and the WHERE clause\\n', 'needs to be birth year and I have to say not null. So that will get rid of\\n', 'that weird row for you, which gave you that\\n', 'really large count, and you should have the\\n', 'result of your question. Any questions about\\n', 'that second rule with respect to group by? Next question. How many movies were released in each year. Each genre per year. First of all, SELECT clause, FROM clause, WHERE clause, and maybe some GROUP BY clause. My recommendation,\\n', 'you can always type a shell of a\\n', 'query like this and then keep it handy and keep copy pasting that every\\n', 'time you answer a question. If you want to, save time. How many movies clearly count\\n', \"of star as movie count? That's what we need. We're released in each genre. Whenever your question\\n\", \"has in each or per each, probably that's going to\\n\", 'be your GROUP BY clause. So the group by clause\\n', 'here is probably going to be genres. So in each genre per year, I felt like I have\\n', 'reordered the question. The result and query that I have in my notes is\\n', \"ordered otherwise. Let's go with each\\n\", \"genre per year. Group by genre. And then group by the other thing that's\\n\", 'going to be year here. Start year. So how many movies were released\\n', 'in each genre per year. You can either group\\n', 'by start here first, and then genre later\\n', \"genres first and start later unless you're actually explicitly\\n\", 'given a specification. P2s questions should have these explicit\\n', 'specifications mentioned. So from the table name is\\n', \"going to be title basics. And then I'm only\\n\", 'interested in movies. So where title _type= movie. And one more thing. I need to explicitly mention\\n', 'start here is not null. What am I missing? Give me a second. Title Type\\n', 'column name. Is incorrect? Once again, I would like to take a look at the\\n', 'associated details here, which what is the start\\n', 'here and what is the genre? So GROUP BY, just like order by can be associated with\\n', 'more than one column. You can do the grouping based on an initial column\\n', 'and then do the sub-grouping within that group based on another columns value. Any questions on using two columns within\\n', 'GROUP BY clause? Next question is going\\n', 'to require you to compute something in order\\n', 'to perform the grouping. So group by, just like the select\\n', 'clause can be associated with\\n', \"computational expressions. You've been asked\\n\", 'to compute this how many movies were\\n', 'released in each decade. So first of all, let me do a select star from\\n', 'title_ basics. So you have the start\\n', 'year information. From the start he year, you need to compute the\\n', 'decade information. Hopefully, all of you\\n', 'are very familiar with how to compute a\\n', 'decade information. From the start here, let me just mention an example, 1909 will belong to\\n', 'the decade 1900s, and 2001 will belong\\n', 'to the Decade 2000s. So how do we compare that? So you need to do\\n', 'integer division in order to extract the\\n', \"decade information. So I'm just going to\\n\", 'go ahead and directly type over the expression\\n', 'here with the hope that all of you are\\n', 'very familiar with taking a year and converting\\n', 'that into a decade. I am going to say start year, and I need the integer\\n', \"division operation. I'll come back to that in case you're not familiar with it. Once I extract the output\\n\", 'of the integer division, I can multiply that by ten, which will give me the\\n', 'decade information. So what do I put in here in SQL, in TG division can be achieved\\n', 'using the DIV operator. So let me go ahead and\\n', 'show you the result of just this query over here. And let me also do select\\n', \"star that you're able to see whether our calculation\\n\", 'is correct or not. 1909, we got a decade\\n', \"of 1,900, 2010. We got a decade of 2010. Hopefully, I don't see it 2020. For 1981, we got\\n\", \"a decade of 1980. That's good. Any questions on this computation before we write the group by\\n\", \"clause with it. Now that we've done\\n\", \"the computation, what else do we need? We'll come back to the how\\n\", 'many movies part later. Let me actually, let me go\\n', 'ahead and type that part now. So count of star as movie count. And I need to make absolutely\\n', 'sure to get rid of the select star Park\\n', \"because now I'm going to type a group I clause. Before that, I need\\n\", 'my WHERE clause. What is going to be\\n', 'my WHERE clause? Again, title type=movie and same condition as last time\\n', 'start here is not null. And then what should be\\n', 'the group by clause? The group by clause should be dependent on your\\n', 'computation over here. In each decade. I stored the result\\n', 'of the computation specifically into\\n', \"a column name so that it's easy for me to\\n\", 'type the group by clause. You can either use decade here or you could\\n', 'literally re retype this whole expression\\n', 'inside the GROUP BY clause. I would prefer to not type the whole thing again\\n', \"so I'm just going to use the column name\\n\", 'that I, generated. So let me go ahead and show\\n', 'you the result of this query. For each decade, you\\n', 'have the movie cut. The only missing part of the\\n', \"puzzle as you've been asked to order by the\\n\", 'latest decade first? Where should the\\n', 'order by clause go? The order by clause\\n', 'is going to always be the penultimate clause\\n', 'in a SQL query. The last one will always\\n', 'be the thumb filtering, which is the limit clause. Where should the\\n', 'order by clause go? The order by clause\\n', \"should go one level above the limit clause. So that's going to be\\n\", \"the penultimate one. So order by, and then what? We want the latest decade first, so I'll have to use the\\n\", 'descending ordering. Any questions on how to use expressions with\\n', 'group by clauses? Rule of thumb here\\n', 'from this example, whenever your group by clause uses a particular expression, the same expression must be present within\\n', \"the select clause. If that is not obvious, that's where you actually\\n\", 'compute the expression, so both of those should match. So next question. How many decades had more\\n', 'than five released movies? So we have one more\\n', \"condition to impose here. Now I'm going to\\n\", 'copy the query from the previous question\\n', 'because this one also builds upon the\\n', 'previous question, just like the previous examples. How many decades had more\\n', 'than five released movies? We ordered the result\\n', 'of the previous query using the latest decade here. You could answer this\\n', 'question without actually using the\\n', 'having clause by simply ordering the result\\n', \"of the previous query using the movie count column and then using a limit clause. But I don't want to\\n\", 'show you that way because I want to introduce\\n', \"the having clause. I'm just like\\n\", 'telling you there is one more way of\\n', \"solving this question. I'm going to show\\n\", 'you the having way of solving this question. What exactly does H having\\n', \"clause enable us to do? That's the sixth\\n\", \"basic SQL clause. It's going to enable us to\\n\", 'filter the aggregates based on the groupings that\\n', 'you have done on a particular condition that depends on the aggregate\\n', 'computation itself. So rule of thumb with having, you should not be able to\\n', 'apply the condition inside the having clause on the original database\\n', \"tables columns. So what is the condition here? More than five released movies. You don't really have the info from the original\\n\", 'database table. It is coming from this\\n', 'aggregate computation, which is movie count. We should the having clause go? It needs to go after\\n', 'the group by clause, and it needs to be\\n', 'associated with a condition. Having movie count\\n', \"greater than five. I'm going to leave the\\n\", 'order by clause in as such. Just in case if we wanted\\n', 'to have the same ordering. Any questions about\\n', 'combining all of these six clauses together? Now, as I mentioned, if you wanted to do\\n', 'simplistic limit filtering, that will be the very last\\n', 'thing that needs to go. So the ordering is always\\n', 'going to be select from where group by having\\n', \"order by, and then limit. For instance, if you just wanted the top five results here, of course, that's not what\\n\", 'the question is asking. So, I have a question from the next question\\n', \"for all of you. It's time for top hat question. Please take a minute\\n\", 'to read this question. The top hat question is going\\n', 'to ask you which part of this question is\\n', 'about having clause? As always, please discuss. [BACKGROUND] Please make sure to submit your response if you\\n', \"haven't already done that. I think most of you got\\n\", 'the correct answer. Option B is the correct answer, which is more than five movies. Why is Option B the\\n', 'correct answer? Hopefully, all of you are\\n', 'able to recognize that option A is literally coming\\n', 'from the starter column, which is part of the original database\\n', 'tables set of columns. >> As opposed to that, more than five movies, you do not have a count column associated with the\\n', 'title_basics database table. So I actually wrote\\n', 'this question in just for the purpose\\n', \"of top hat question. I'm going to leave this\\n\", \"question up to all of you to solve. I've already given\\n\", \"you the solution. Let's do a quick recap of\\n\", \"the GROUP BY column rules. Unlike the aggregate functions, null values aren't\\n\", 'ignored by GROUP BY, so which means that you\\n', 'need to explicitly filter them out using fetch-row-clause,\\n', 'first rule of thumb. Second rule of thumb.\\n', 'SELECT Clause must only contain\\n', 'aggregate functions. And the columns inside\\n', \"the GROUP BY clause, and I'm sur you example that group clause can include\\n\", 'more than one column, then you can have the select clause include\\n', 'more than one column, assuming that your\\n', 'grouping was also done based on more\\n', 'than one column. Aggregations are only\\n', 'applied to groups of rows. We covered an example\\n', \"to demonstrate this. When you just say select count of star from title_ basics, that'll give you\\n\", \"all of the titles. If you do a GROUP BY column, you'll get aggregate\\n\", 'for every single group. And then final rule here is that expressions and GROUP\\n', \"BY can't be used, but the same expression must be part of the select\\n\", 'clause as well. Any questions at\\n', 'all about any of these rules associated with\\n', 'the GROUP BY clause or any questions at all about the six basic equal\\n', 'clauses before we talk about order\\n', 'of execution. Let me zoom out\\n', \"slightly over here. My apologies if you can't see the text very\\n\", 'clearly from the back. I wanted to have the\\n', \"full picture over here. Let's talk about the\\n\", 'order of execution of the six equal clauses or\\n', \"seven basic equal clauses. Let's include limit as well. So obviously, From is going to be the very first clause\\n\", 'that gets executed. Why? Your database\\n', 'has multiple tables, which means that\\n', 'the first point of selection here is\\n', 'going to be table. Your query is going\\n', \"to talk about. So you're going to first have the FROM clause being applied. So you'll first narrow down to a particular table of data. After from clause, the very first clause that gets applied is the fetch clause, fetch clause is going\\n\", 'to enable you to filter rows based on a\\n', \"particular columns condition, so you're going to end\\n\", 'up with fewer rows, hopefully than\\n', 'before, assuming that your condition actually works\\n', 'on your database table. And then following\\n', \"the fetch clause, you're going to be executing\\n\", 'the group by clause. The group by clause is now going to take your\\n', 'individual rows, and then find out\\n', \"the unique values associated with the column based on which you're\\n\", \"doing a grouping. Let's assume for simplistic\\n\", \"case that you're only grouping based on a\\n\", \"single columns value. And then you're\\n\", 'going to end up with groups of rows, for example, all the gray rows together, yellow rows together, and so on. After you perform\\n', \"the grouping by, you're going to apply\\n\", 'the aggregate function. Whatever aggregate that\\n', \"you're trying to compute, we've covered some average, max min count then you're going to end up with exactly\\n\", 'same number of rows at this stage\\n', 'as the number of groups that your group\\n', 'by clause gave you. Why exactly same number of rows? Remember, whenever you\\n', \"perform an aggregation, you're actually collapsing\\n\", \"all of those rows together into a single row. Since we had four groups, you're going to end up with\\n\", 'exactly four rows here. And then once you have your\\n', \"aggregate functions result, you're going to apply\\n\", 'the having clause. And then after you do\\n', 'the having clause, the penultimate clause is\\n', 'going to be ordered by. And then the last clause here is going to be limit over here. So why should having clause be used on aggregates\\n', 'instead of fetch clause? If it is not already clear, I have a diagrammatic\\n', 'representation that tells you exactly why the case of fetch clause\\n', 'is actually applied before even you\\n', 'perform year grouping. And of course, after\\n', 'the grouping is done is when you can\\n', 'actually do aggregate, so which means that\\n', \"it's quite obvious that having needs to be\\n\", 'the one that is associated with the\\n', 'condition that is not impossible on the original\\n', \"database tables columns. I'm sure at least one of you will have a question\\n\", \"from this diagram. I'm hoping at least\\n\", 'one of you can spot something\\n', 'being missing here. What is missing in this\\n', 'diagram? Select is missing. There are seven\\n', 'basic SQL clauses. Why have I not\\n', \"represented select here? That's because\\n\", 'select is actually challenging to represent. If you think about it, part of the selection happens\\n', 'when you do the group by. First of all, you need to select whatever\\n', \"group you're doing, that particular columns value. So part of the selection happens when you\\n\", 'do the group by. Then part of the selection happens after you do the aggregation and then the\\n', \"having filtering over here. Because after you do this part, that's when you actually determine what the\\n\", 'aggregate results are. Remember that whenever a SQL\\n', 'query has a group by clause, your select clause can only contain one of the two things. It can either have the group grouped column information\\n', 'or the aggregate. So which means that\\n', \"you can't quite place select in a precise ordering. Part of it happens when\\n\", 'you do the grouping by, and then part of it\\n', 'happens when you perform the\\n', 'aggregation over here. Any questions at all about the SQL clause\\n', 'execution order or how you would actually literally type the\\n', \"SQL clauses as well? Here. Perfect. Let's move\\n\", 'on to SQL subqueries. One thing that I want\\n', 'to mention before I go through this\\n', 'write up, sometimes, instead of digressing from the lecture by having you\\n', 'switch over to slides, I might actually literally\\n', 'dump the slides content into the notebook file so\\n', \"that it's just easy for us to keep up with the\\n\", \"flow of the lecture. Today's lecture is\\n\", 'one such example. So rule of thumb for all of you, any content that is\\n', 'descriptive inside the lecture Demo Notebook\\n', 'File is testable content, so which means that\\n', 'you should know that. So this is exactly\\n', 'like me putting content into a slide.\\n', \"Hopefully, that's clear. Now, rather than\\n\", 'switch to a slide, I have the content inside\\n', 'my notebook file over here, and now I can go\\n', \"back to zooming in. Let's talk about SQL subqueries. What exactly is a subquery? The definition is quite simple, a query that is going to contain another query is\\n\", \"nothing but a subquery. The outer query that's containing\\n\", 'the other SQL query is typically referred to as\\n', \"the containing statement or the containing query, and I'll use this\\n\", \"terminology as well. So I didn't quite\\n\", \"get a chance to update the reading for today's lecture\\n\", \"before the lecture. I'll do it when I release\\n\", \"the lecture recording. So you'll see if you're following\\n\", \"along with the reading, you'll see that the\\n\", \"book from which we're doing the reading use\\n\", 'a similar terminology. So What can a subquery\\n', 'be used with? A subquery can be used with\\n', 'all four SQL data statements. And typically, select insert\\n', 'update and delete are referred to as the four\\n', 'SQL data statements, anything that you\\n', 'associate with data. We are going to focus\\n', \"mainly on select examples, but you're welcome\\n\", 'to explore examples using insert update and\\n', \"delete if you're interested. A subquery is always executed prior to the\\n\", \"containing statement. That is you're going to execute the sub query before you execute the\\n\", 'containing statement. And once you execute the\\n', \"containing statement, you're actually going to throw away the subqueries result. So subqueries act like a temporary table within\\n\", \"the statements scope. As long as you're still executing the\\n\", 'containing statement, your subqueries result will\\n', 'still be there in memory. And once the containing\\n', \"statement is done executing, you're going to throw away\\n\", \"the result of the subquery. You're not going quite said, like I said, temporary table\\n\", \"that you're generating. Subqueries can return one of\\n\", 'one of these three things, like a regular query would do. It can either return a single\\n', 'row with a single column, multiple rows with\\n', 'a single column, and multiple rows with\\n', \"multiple columns. We'll cover examples for\\n\", \"at least two of those, I think, during today's lecture. There are two types\\n\", 'of sub queries. Non-correlated subqueries, which are self\\n', 'contained subqueries. The subqueries not going to be dependent on the\\n', 'contained query. Those are non\\n', 'correlated subqueries. Majority of the queries\\n', 'that you encounter for data analysis are\\n', 'typically going to be non correlated rather\\n', 'than being correlated. That said, what are\\n', 'correlated subqueries? Your subquery is going to reference column from the\\n', 'containing statement. You can have correlated\\n', \"subqueries as well. So let's dive into non\\n\", 'correlated subqueries first. Let me define another term, which is what is\\n', 'a scale subquery. A scalar subquery is nothing\\n', 'but a query that returns a resulting set that contains a single row and\\n', \"a single column. And we'll cover\\n\", 'examples of that first. With the subqueries result set, that is the scalar\\n', 'subqueries result set, you can use that along with\\n', 'conditional operators. Again, recap of what the conditional operators\\n', 'are, typically, you should be aware of equal to less than less\\n', 'than or equal to greater than and greater than\\n', 'or equal to not equal to. How do you denote not equal\\n', \"to in the world of SQL? It's going to be using less than greater than symbol\\n\", \"just in case, if you're not familiar with SQL syntax I've given you that. So, let's focus on single row single column\\n\", 'subqueries first, by diving directly\\n', 'into an example. What is the shortest movie\\n', \"that was released after 2010? Let's just solve\\n\", 'the sub query here. Can somebody identify\\n', 'the sub query here? What do we need in\\n', 'order to be able to answer this\\n', \"original question?

You would need more than\\n', 'movies released after 2010 to be able to answer\\n', \"the original query. It's asking for shortest\\n\", 'movie released after 2010.

            "[\"technical glitches. If there are no other questions, I'm going to get started\\n\", 'with some slides. I think the first couple of learning objectives were listed as part of the previous\\n', \"lecture as well. We didn't quite get to\\n\", 'actually go through examples, which are about chaining Linux programs together\\n', \"to form a pipeline. We'll go through examples\\n\", \"for such commands today. And we'll also be going through the process behind\\n\", \"redirecting output to a file, and we'll also cover\\n\", \"examples for that. We're going to go through\\n\", 'a couple of commands, which will help us observe\\n', 'resource consumption on Linux. That will come in handy in case you run into a situation\\n', 'where your VM is too slow due to some reason and\\n', 'you need to figure out what exactly is causing\\n', \"the VM to be slow. Let's first learn\\n\", 'about two terms which are standard input\\n', \"and standard output. First of all, what is a process? I'm assuming all of you here\\n\", 'know what a program is. Program is something\\n', \"that you write code for. When you run a program, an instance of a running program is referred to as a process. So we'll often talk about what a particular process is doing within your virtual machine or within your Docker\\n\", 'container, for example. All of the processes get input in the form\\n', 'of standard input, typically from a\\n', 'keyboard and produce output to something called\\n', 'STD out standard output. The typical location for sending the output is going\\n', \"to be onto your screen, and we're going to\\n\", \"talk about different ways of manipulating that. So let's first talk about how do you chain two\\n\", 'commands together. The basic unix\\n', 'philosophy, which is, unix is the basis for all\\n', 'kinds of Linux platforms, is that they wanted to make the commands as\\n', 'simple as possible. So most of these commands\\n', 'are going to be good at doing one or two things. And then if you want to do\\n', \"something more complicated, you're going to have to chain more than one command together. So that is one typical\\n\", 'unix philosophy. The second one is\\n', 'that they wanted to keep the programs simple in such a way that they produce a standard form of output, which can be provided as\\n', 'input to some other program. So the symbol that enables you to chain two commands together is something\\n', 'called the pipe symbol, the vertical line over here. What is going to happen is that the output program\\n', 'A is now going to become input stdin for\\n', 'program B over here. And this process is\\n', 'referred to as piping the output from program A\\n', 'to the input of program B. Program A and B can be\\n', 'running simultaneously, or program A might finish first, and then B might run it, depends on what computing\\n', 'environment you have. That is do you have a CPU that has multiple\\n', 'course and whether more than one course are\\n', \"actually available at the same time to be able to run these two programs together? Why can't they run\\n\", \"simultaneously? That's because, your operating system actually keeps track of intermediate output that is going to come from\\n\", 'the first program. So even though program A\\n', \"hasn't fully finished, it might have already produced some lines of\\n\", 'intermediate output, which can already be pushed\\n', 'as Input 2 program B, so they could possibly\\n', 'run simultaneously? Any questions on the basics\\n', \"of how pipelining works? We'll cover a lot of demo\\n\", 'examples just so you know, so you can chain\\n', 'multiple commands together by simply just using multiple pipe symbols\\n', 'and also associating multiple different\\n', 'shell commands. So instead of just\\n', 'saying A pipe B, you could say A\\n', 'pipe B pipe C. So the third thing\\n', \"that we're going to talk about with\\n\", 'respect to process, which is a running program\\n', 'is something called stderr. Which is the short form\\n', 'for standard error. So typically, when\\n', \"a program crashes, you're going to want\\n\", 'to send the output that caused the crash into\\n', 'standard error as opposed to standard output so as to help whoever is\\n', 'running the process gain information and\\n', 'knowledge as to why exactly that particular process crashed or program crashed. So typically, when you have, a pipeline set up, you do not actually chain\\n', 'the standard error because the second process over\\n', 'here B is not going to do anything with the standard\\n', \"error output from process A. It's likely that if\\n\", \"process A fails, process B will also fail because it's expecting input\\n\", 'from process A. So in this case,\\n', 'the standard error is going to just get\\n', 'directed to the screen, and you can see the output of any error that any of\\n', \"those programs encounter. Let's now talk\\n\", 'about redirection. So we learned about how to\\n', 'chain commands together, using the process of piping, redirection is\\n', 'going to be able to take the output from a process\\n', 'and put it into a file. Just to make the\\n', 'difference clear, piping is going to take the\\n', 'output from one process, give us input to\\n', 'another process, so it is process to process, as opposed to that, redirection is going to be process to file. So typically, when you just run a regular shell command\\n', \"on your terminal, you're just going to direct both the standard output and the standard error\\n\", 'onto a screen. What if you wanted to\\n', 'save the standard output into a file for futuristic\\n', 'logging purposes. For example, if we\\n', 'want to redirect the standard output from\\n', \"process A to output.txt, we're going to have to\\n\", 'stop process A by typing whatever program initiation\\n', 'line you need to type. And then the redirection symbol is going to be\\n', 'greater than symbol, also referred to as arrow\\n', 'by some programmers. A arrow output.txt\\n', 'is going to redirect standard output into a\\n', 'file called output.txt. And then you can come back to access the output from there. So how do you redirect\\n', 'standard error? One thing that I would like\\n', 'to let all of you know, you have three things here. Standard in, standard\\n', 'out, and standard error. Standard in has the Number 0, associated with it\\n', 'standard output is one, standard error is two. Even though we say A greater\\n', 'than symbol output.txt, you could also say A one\\n', 'greater than output.txt. But people generally avoid\\n', \"that because it's like very evident that you're redirecting output just\\n\", 'with greater than. So how do you redirect\\n', 'standard error? You need to say\\n', 'two greater than, and then a file name, for example, errors dot.txt. So you can put both\\n', 'of those together using Ampers re\\n', \"greater than symbol, that's going to redirect both stdout and stderr\\n\", 'to a file called output.txt and\\n', 'whoever is running that particular process needs to differentiate between the\\n', 'output and the standard error. Any questions on the basics\\n', 'of redirection before we talk about how to run\\n', 'things asynchronously? So on your terminal, when you type some\\n', 'shell command or any command for that matter, not essentially just shell, you are going to\\n', \"start that particular tosses synchronously, that is, you're going to have to wait\\n\", \"until the process finishes execution before you're actually able to use the terminal\\n\", 'session further. But might not work out always. What if you have a\\n', \"really slow program that's going to keep\\n\", 'running for a while, and you want to do other things, because all of our\\n', 'time is precious. So how do you run programs in the background,\\n', \"asynchronously? You're going to have to use\\n\", 'ampersand at the end of the line that initiates\\n', 'that particular process. For example, slow program. Ampersand is going to start\\n', \"it in the background. You're going to be able to\\n\", 'find the process ID for that particular process and do actions like kill it and\\n', 'redirect the output, and keep following the output\\n', 'using the tail command. Hopefully, all of you remember the follow option from tail. That we discussed last time instead of saying tail\\n', 'and then a file name, you could say tail hyphen-F, which is an option for\\n', 'the tail shell command, and then you can\\n', 'say the file name. You can keep following\\n', 'the output as the slow process\\n', \"produces the output. So let's combine both chaining\\n\", 'and redirection together. Here is a command that\\n', 'does both of those things. So process A standard output is going to become standard\\n', 'input to process B. And what else are we doing? We are making sure to redirect\\n', 'both the standard error and standard output from process B to a file\\n', \"called out.txt, and we're running\\n\", \"this whole chain of programs in the background, let's say that it's\\n\", 'going to run slowly. Any questions at all before we continue the\\n', 'demo where we left off. Let me open my terminal. Once again, can everybody in\\n', 'the back see the terminal? Good. Awesome. Thank you\\n', 'for confirming that. Hopefully, all of\\n', 'you have gotten a chance to set up\\n', \"your virtual machine. If you haven't\\n\", 'already, please make sure to set it up\\n', 'as soon as you can. You definitely would want to follow along with the\\n', \"Wednesday's lecture demo, where I'm going to start\\n\", \"talking about Docker. Docker might be new if you're\\n\", 'not coming in from CS 544, which not many of you\\n', 'have done that course. So just a review from\\n', \"previous lecture. Once you've set up your GCPVM, you're going to have to use\\n\", 'the SSH-Key gen command to create an SSH key. There have been a couple\\n', 'of questions that were asked about during my officers. Do you really need to\\n', \"generate the SSH key? Can't you just use the\\n\", 'GCP console to log in into your machine using the UI form of SSH key\\n', 'interior virtual machine? Yes, you can. But here is\\n', 'the problem with that. If you need multiple sessions, you need to keep\\n', \"opening multiple tabs, and at some point, that's going to become challenging\\n\", 'for you to manage. As opposed to that terminal\\n', 'tabs are easier to navigate. So personally, I would\\n', 'definitely recommend generating an SSH key in order to\\n', \"access your machine via SSH. So once you generate the key, you're going to have username\\n\", \"in the metadata tab. You're going to say SSH, your username at, and then the global IP address or the public facing IP address, which you can get\\n\", 'from the VM instances tab from compute engine. So that will enable you\\n', 'to log into your machine. Recall that PWD stands for\\n', \"print working directory. Typically, it's going to take\\n\", 'you to your home directory, which will be slash home, and then your username. Recall that CD stands\\n', 'for change directory. Dot dot is a special use\\n', \"case where you're able to change the current\\n\", 'working directory to one directory above in\\n', \"the directory hierarchy. So I'm going to go from\\n\", '/home/msyamkumar/home. LS is the command that enables you to list\\n', 'files and directories. You have various options\\n', 'that you can use for LS. -L stands for detail listing, -H stands for human readable. Hopefully, all of you remember the details that we\\n', 'discussed with respect to various permissions over here associated with each\\n', 'different file or directory. Last lecture, we left off the demo by\\n', 'creating a file called secret.txt by going\\n', 'into superuser mode, in order to bypass the\\n', 'password requirement for SU, we literally used\\n', 'pseudo SU and went into root user and created\\n', \"this file called secret.txt, which I'm using cat on cat\\n\", 'stands for concatenate enables you to dump the output of a\\n', 'file of many other use cases.

Recall from last lecture, the first one out of\\n', 'these 10 characters indicates whether something\\n', 'is a file or a directory.

I am not the owner of\\n', 'that particular file, so my permissions are\\n', 'going to come from these last three\\n', 'factors over here. Recall that those stands\\n', 'for rwx, which read, write, and execute what action\\n', \"am I doing when I do cat? I'm just reading the\\n\", 'contents of the file.

And I want the query to be\\n', \"able to match all the results. So I'm going to have a\\n\", \"match all as my operator, and whenever you have match all, you're going to have\\n\", 'an empty dictionary as the corresponding argument. And I will come back\\n', \"to telling you why exactly we're configuring\\n\", \"the size field as zero. For now, let's just type it in. And how do you\\n\", \"perform aggregation? You're going to be mentioning the aggregation operation inside a field value pair where\\n\", 'your field name is aggs. And the value is going\\n', 'to be a dictionary. Whenever you perform\\n', \"an aggregation, you're going to end\\n\", \"up with a brand new value that's being computed. So you're going to\\n\", 'end up defining a new field that will go into the response\\n', 'object instance. So let me just configure the\\n', 'field as total restaurants. And the value corresponding to that needs to\\n', \"be a dictionary. Inside the dictionary, you're\\n\", 'going to have to mention what kind of\\n', 'aggregation operation that you want to perform. And the count\\n', 'aggregation is achieved by using an operator\\n', 'called value_count. And as the value corresponding to that\\n', \"within a dictionary, you're going to have\\n\", 'to explicitly say what field you need to use to perform\\n', 'the count operation. So here is the first use\\n', 'case scenario where you cannot use a text\\n', \"based field as such. So let me run the query. As you can see, you're running\\n\", \"into a bad request error. That's because DBA\\n\", 'field is of type text. How can you confirm that? Hopefully, all of\\n', 'you remember from the previous lecture\\n', 'that you can use the get_mapping method\\n', \"by specifying the index. I see underscore index. I'm just blacking out on the details of the\\n\", 'other arguments here. Let me just run it as such. Indices.getmapping,\\n', \"isn't it? There you go. So if you look for\\n\", 'DBA field in here, which should be\\n', 'somewhere in here. Let me just focus on\\n', \"some other field. It doesn't really matter as to which field we're\\n\", 'talking about. So for example,\\n', 'the action field, as you can see, the type\\n', 'of the field is text. So here is the fundamental\\n', 'thing that you need to know about text type of fields\\n', 'with an elastic search. Elastic search always configures the text type field to perform full text search.\\n', 'What do I mean by that? That would mean that\\n', 'the fields value is always going to be\\n', \"tokenized and stemmed. So basically, it's not going to have the original\\n\", \"text as such. Instead, it's going to\\n\", 'have a tokenized version of the original field. That would make it a\\n', 'little bit tricky. How do you actually\\n', 'count the number of restaurant names once\\n', 'the restaurant names are tokenized to enable\\n', \"you to perform searches? So that's why whenever\\n\", \"you have a text field, you're going to have a subfield within that called keyword, which is going to enable you to perform non full text\\n\", 'based searches that is like operations like\\n', 'aggregation for which you actually want the\\n', 'original fields value without tokenization. Any questions at all about this? >> Now, how do you access\\n', \"the keyword field? It's a nested field. So you need to use the\\n\", 'dot operator and you need to say.keyword here, and that will enable you to count the number of restaurants for which you actually have the DBA keyword field defined. Notice that eight\\n', \"or so restaurants actually don't have a name. Definitely somebody messed up in terms of creating this dataset. You cannot inspect a\\n\", 'non-existent restaurant or restaurant with no name. Any questions so\\n', 'far before I talk about why this size\\n', 'field should be zero? So before we take a look\\n', \"at the fields in here, let's literally dump the\\n\", \"response object instance. So that's what I\\n\", 'would recommend for every single\\n', 'aggregation operation because the response\\n', 'object instance is going to look different. So within aggregation,\\n', \"you're going to have whatever name of the new\\n\", 'field that you created, which is going to be\\n', 'total restaurants, and the value corresponding\\n', 'to that is going to be your actual aggregate value. So that said, why should we have this field size of zero and what would happen\\n', \"if I remove that? Well, that's going to give you the actual documents that are matching in your search results. You don't quite need that when your query is all\\n\", 'about aggregation. So whenever you have\\n', \"an aggregate query, you're going to have to\\n\", 'configure your size to be zero so as to not\\n', 'clutter your response object instance with\\n', 'the actual hits that the scoring algorithm\\n', 'is retrieving. Of course, this is a\\n', \"simplistic example because I'm not searching for anything\\n\", \"and I'm matching everything. You can always imagine\\n\", 'applying a query and then applying an aggregation\\n', 'operation on top of the query. Any questions at all\\n', 'about the basics of aggregation operations? Yeah. >> [inaudible] >> Actually, I have to\\n', 'be honest with you. I have no idea what\\n', 'that field represents. I am going to have\\n', 'to go back and read the Elasticsearch\\n', 'documentation to be able to give you an answer. Sorry about that. And I\\n', 'should say at this point, Elasticsearch\\n', 'documentation is not the easiest documentation\\n', \"to read, unfortunately. That's just me\\n\", \"being kind to them. So let's move on to other\\n\", 'aggregation examples. And I am actually not going to type the\\n', 'solution from scratch. I think at this point,\\n', 'all of you guys know how to type a query and\\n', \"format it really well. Let's just do rapid fire and\\n\", \"go through these questions. I'm in a good mood. We might end the\\n\", 'lecture early today. That way, you guys\\n', 'can go back and actually wrap up P4 as well. So Question 4, find the total score of all restaurant inspections\\n', 'in the dataset. So clearly, you need the\\n', \"sum form of aggregation. And I don't need to\\n\", \"quite specify the query here because I'm just\\n\", 'wanting to compare the total score of all the\\n', 'restaurant inspections. And you can always\\n', 'display just one of the matching documents\\n', 'by running the match all query to find what field\\n', \"you're supposed to look for, or you could go to\\n\", 'your data source and open the JSON file and actually find which field\\n', \"corresponds to the score here. As you can see, there's\\n\", \"an actual field that has the name score. And that's what we're\\n\", \"going to be summing up. And the name of the new field that I'm creating is going to be total score. And the aggregate operator\\n\", 'is going to be sum. And I need to specify what field I want the\\n', \"sum of the values for. And that's going to\\n\", 'be the score field. And that gives you a total\\n', 'of that score field. Rapid fire more\\n', 'math calculations for stats. Average score. Your operator is\\n', \"going to be avg, and that's the average score. Minimum score. Operator is going to be min. And clearly, this inspection was a good one for the restaurant owner because\\n\", 'they got a score of zero. Zero is a good score. That means they\\n', 'have no violations. This question should be\\n', 'what is the maximum, and not minimum, max score. That sounds like a\\n', 'bad inspection, 142. They clearly had a\\n', 'lot of violations. I am not at all surprised given how much rat problems\\n', 'that New York City has. Their max score of 142, in this subset version\\n', \"of this dataset, I wouldn't be surprised\\n\", 'if it is even as high as 500 or something. So any questions about\\n', \"math-based aggregations? So let's solve the next\\n\", \"question from scratch. I'm not going to leave\\n\", 'all questions for you to look at the code here because that makes the\\n', 'lecture less interesting. What are the top 20 most\\n', \"common cuisine types among the inspected restaurants? So that's going to\\n\", \"be the next question that we'll be answering. And once again, you\\n\", 'will have to work with the keyword subfield\\n', 'within cuisine description because cuisine description\\n', \"is of type text. So let's get started with the aggregation\\n\", \"operation here, aggs. That's where we need to start. And we are going to just count the number of cuisines for now. And let me specify a dictionary as an argument corresponding to the new\\n\", 'field cuisine count. And within here,\\n', 'I am going to be performing unique cuisine\\n', 'type aggregation here. And the operator for that is going to be the terms operator, terms with an m, not with an n. And the value here is going\\n', 'to be a dictionary, where you mention the\\n', 'name of the field. And in this case, the name of the field is going\\n', 'to be cuisine description. I am going to copy paste that. I have a feeling I will most definitely make a typo if I\\n', \"try to type that field name. Let me copy paste. Cuisine description. That's going to be the\\n\", 'name of the field. And then I need to extract\\n', 'the subfield keyword, so it needs to\\n', 'be.keyword beyond that. And how do you restrict the\\n', 'number of responses to 20? Turns out that inside the\\n', 'terms operator dictionary, you could configure\\n', 'a size in here, and you could just say return the top 20 such terms\\n', 'within cuisine description. And let me run that. These are the top 20\\n', 'cuisine descriptions and the corresponding aggregate\\n', 'value in terms of the count. The terms operator\\n', 'does two things. It will enable you to take into account the unique terms\\n', 'inside the original field, which would be the\\n', \"original cuisine types. For instance, American, Chinese. So when you go through the data, you'll actually see\\n\", 'restaurants have the entire cuisine\\n', \"description as Asian or Asian fusion here. So it's coming from the\\n\", 'original fields unique values. And the count corresponds\\n', 'to the number of restaurants that have that\\n', 'original cuisine description. So terms does two\\n', 'different things here. Any questions at all\\n', 'about Question 8? So Question 9 introduces\\n', 'histograms for you. Hopefully, all of you are\\n', \"familiar with histograms. Hopefully, you've\\n\", 'taken a stat course that introduces histograms. Histograms enable you to bin similar data\\n', 'points together. So the question here is asking, how many restaurants fall into each inspection score range\\n', \"in the interval of five? Whenever you're\\n\", \"defining a histogram, you need to define a bin size. That's what the interval\\n\", 'here refers to. In Elasticsearch, the\\n', 'term that you use to specify the bin size\\n', \"for histogram is interval. That's why the question\\n\", \"says intervals of five. Let's go ahead and create a\\n\", 'new field score histogram. The name of the operator here is going to be the\\n', 'histogram operator. You need to specify what field you want to\\n', 'consider for creating the histogram and\\n', 'what needs to be the interval for the bins\\n', 'that you want to choose here. Hopefully, given that\\n', 'our min value for the score was zero and max\\n', 'value for the score was 142, given a bin size of five, we should see bins of size\\n', 'five starting from zero up until 140 if we run\\n', 'this histogram code. One way for you to verify that your code is actually working, by executing min and max, you can confirm what is\\n', 'the min and the max score or whatever the\\n', \"field that you're using to generate the histogram. So the histogram here is\\n\", 'going to give you the bins, which are going to\\n', 'have the starting point value for the bins, and the count is going to be the number of\\n', 'restaurants who have had scores that fall within\\n', 'that particular bin. Any questions about\\n', 'histogram creation? So we already learned how\\n', 'to use terms operator to combine the unique\\n', 'occurrences of terms along with the\\n', \"count of those terms. Let's learn how to\\n\", 'literally find the number of unique cuisine types\\n', \"that have been inspected. And this time, I'm going to introduce the\\n\", 'cardinality operator, which enables you to perform the count of the unique\\n', 'occurrences of the terms. So the difference between\\n', 'the terms operator and the cardinality operator is that the terms operator\\n', 'does two things. It figures out the number\\n', 'of unique terms in your original data and also does the count of the\\n', 'number of documents that correspond to that\\n', 'particular unique term. As opposed to that,\\n', 'cardinality only gives you the count of number\\n', \"of unique terms. So it's going to return\\n\", 'an integer value here inside aggregation unique\\n', 'cuisines and value. So you have 76 unique\\n', \"cuisine descriptions in this version of the dataset. Any questions at all about the New York City JSON dataset or any of the search processes that you go through with that? We'll come back to\\n\", 'this at the end of this notebook with\\n', \"one GEOquery example, but we're going to\\n\", 'mainly focus on Kibana for helping us go through\\n', \"geovisualization. Before that, I'm\\n\", 'going to go over how to how to index the\\n', 'text data that we have. So let me go back to my\\n', 'Jupyter Notebook home screen. So let me take a minute\\n', 'to talk about what exactly this dump\\n', 'of text files are. So hopefully, most of you would have heard of the\\n', 'term Wiki dump. If not, let me tell\\n', 'you what Wiki dump is. Wiki dump enables you to get a crawled version of almost the entire\\n', 'Wikipedia if you want to. You can literally crawl\\n', 'the entire Wikipedia in about 2-4 hours depending on\\n', 'how fast your Internet is, and you could have a copy of Wikipedia on your\\n', 'computing machine. Of course, this is not an\\n', 'entire dump of Wikipedia. What I do then, there is a Python module\\n', \"that you can use. I believe it's called\\n\", \"wikidump, hopefully, I'm not naming the\\n\", 'module incorrectly, which enables you to crawl Wiki dump to extract\\n', 'specific things. So I just wrote some\\n', 'custom code to extract everything to do with New\\n', 'York City restaurants, and Wiki dump returned\\n', 'these number of TXT files for all of us to\\n', 'process and ingest and do whatever we want with\\n', 'that particular data. I wanted the text data to be\\n', 'relevant to the JSON data, hence specific search with respect to New York\\n', 'City restaurants. Of course, I skipped the\\n', 'inspection part of things. Probably would have led us to\\n', 'have much narrower results. So my data directory contains\\n', 'all of these text files. Arin did something\\n', 'similar for P4, excepting that he did\\n', \"some post-processing. The reason why I'm mentioning that is if you open one\\n\", \"of these text files, you'll notice that the\\n\", 'original Wikipedia format is in there as such. I did not quite do\\n', 'any clean up at all. I just wanted you to have\\n', 'the raw data from Wiki dump. So the difference between\\n', \"Arin's text files and my files is that Arin's text files are\\n\", 'a little bit more readable because he has done\\n', 'post-processing. By the way, he has\\n', 'released the scripts that he wrote to do the crawling\\n', \"and clean up and everything. If you're curious, feel\\n\", \"free to check those out. So that's the data. Let me go back here. So the key difference\\n\", 'between indexing JSON data versus\\n', \"indexing text data is that you don't really\\n\", 'have a JSON format. Elasticsearch expects\\n', 'your document to have JSON format in order\\n', \"to perform indexing, which means that we're going\\n\", \"to do one very simple thing. We're going to take\\n\", 'the entire content of individual text files and map the data as value corresponding\\n', 'to field called Wiki, dump that entire thing\\n', \"into a dictionary, and then index that document. As simple as that. I'm not\\n\", 'doing anything else at all. Just taking the\\n', 'text file content, instead of using the\\n', 'text file format, creating a basic simple JSON by introducing the field name as Wiki and the value as the content of the\\n', 'individual files. And the helpers bulk\\n', 'function syntax is exactly the same as before, excepting that previously\\n', 'we were indexing individual documents\\n', \"inside the JSON file. Now we're indexing\\n\", 'the entire text file as a single document. So I mentioned that in P4, Arin expects you to index\\n', 'the entire JSON files also as a single document instead of iterating over the\\n', \"individual documents inside. Let's say, the Halloween.JSON. I think it has all\\n\", 'the array fields that happened on Halloween. So instead of iterating\\n', 'over those array entries, he expects you to index the entire JSON as\\n', \"a single document. And I'm doing the\\n\", 'same thing here with the text files as well. So only new thing is\\n', \"that I'm creating a brand new index because I don't want to clutter\\n\", \"the previous index, because this is a lot of unclean data that I don't want to dump on\\n\", 'the original index. And let me show you\\n', 'the output of get mapping method for\\n', 'New York Wiki index. So this time, your properties is only going to have\\n', \"one single field, and that's going to\\n\", 'be the Wiki field as one would expect\\n', \"the types of text. So that's why you're able to perform full\\n\", 'text search on this. And then you also have\\n', 'the keyword field, if you want the original values and not the tokenized values. So this will give you\\n', \"all of the content. The size is 2546, but you don't have\\n\", 'that many documents with the Wiki dump dataset. Any questions on how to\\n', 'index the text data set? >> Simplistic search query. I was very surprised to see other country references\\n', \"inside this dataset. Mainly, it's coming from\\n\", 'the TGIF search result. I think the TGIF\\n', 'Wikipedia page has a list of all the countries where there are\\n', 'TGIF restaurants. Because New York City is\\n', \"where TGIF originated, it's obviously, associated\\n\", 'with New York City. And clearly we have\\n', 'TGIF restaurants in New York City as well. So because of that, other countries are showing\\n', 'up in this dataset, and I just wanted to show you a simplistic search example. Any questions at all about this? So, unlike P4 dataset, my dataset does not really\\n', 'contain nested fields, the New York City\\n', 'Restaurants JSON data set. So I just wanted to go over\\n', 'one simple example as to how you can write search queries\\n', 'with the nested fields. And I am taking an example from the same inspiration\\n', \"as before Game of Thrones, if you've watched the show, and if you like the book. So I have a simplistic\\n\", 'example here, where I have three\\n', \"different documents. And I've grouped John\\n\", \"Snow into no group, and a bunch of Starks into Starks' group and a bunch of\\n\", \"Arryns into Arryns' group. So inside each of\\n\", 'these documents, you have a nested field, the user field, which is\\n', 'going to be of array type. And in there, you have a dictionary\\n', \"representing every user. And I'm just indexing\\n\", 'these three documents, same code as before\\n', 'that we learned initially when we were\\n', \"exploring the API method calls. So I'm just going\\n\", 'to show you how exactly you can\\n', 'specify the subfield, just like how you access the keyword field by saying\\n', 'cuisinedescription.keyword. Even any of the other original\\n', 'sub fields can also be accessed using the\\n', 'dot operator user as the original field dot, and then followed by first, which is going to be\\n', 'the subfield here. Hopefully, that should give\\n', 'us two such results here. Total hit value of two because\\n', \"I'm searching for John. There's a John\\n\", 'Snow inside Doc 1, and then there is a John\\n', 'Arryn inside Doc 3. Last stop, I wanted to\\n', 'just for the sake of completeness\\n', 'introduce geo query. Geo distance is\\n', 'going to look very similar to what you\\n', 'did with the MongoDB, accepting that here is\\n', 'one primary problem. Let me show you the\\n', \"original dataset, and it's going to come in\\n\", \"handy for the Kibana examples, which we're going to dive into the next minute right\\n\", 'after this geo query. So the original data set. Notice that the latitude\\n', 'and the longitude are of type floating points. So if you go back and\\n', \"look at the mapping, you'll be able to\\n\", 'find these two fields and not look them\\n', 'up in a dictionary. Find those two fields and find the corresponding value type. So for geo qeries to work, Elasticsearch expects\\n', 'your geodata to have a very specific\\n', 'format, that is, it expects you to\\n', 'have configured your geodata into a field\\n', 'that has the type geo point. And within that\\n', \"particular field, you're expected to have the latitude and the\\n\", 'longitude information, which needs to be a floating\\n', 'point type, of course. So in order to make\\n', \"sure that we're able to go through geo\\n\", 'queries on this dataset, I am going to have to\\n', 'update my mapping so as to create the new mapping\\n', \"type as geo point. So I'm going to introduce\\n\", 'how you can achieve this, and you need to\\n', 'perform index creation using this new mapping that\\n', \"you're going to be defining. The mapping is going\\n\", \"to be a dictionary. Within the mappings dictionary, you're going to be\\n\", 'configuring properties. Inside the properties,\\n', \"you're going to control what specific field you want to change the\\n\", 'property type to. In this case, I\\n', 'want to introduce a new field called\\n', 'location and then I want to make sure my\\n', 'latitude and longitude have the floating\\n', 'point types over here, which they already do. So, I am going to create a brand new index now called\\n', 'newyorkcityrestaurants_geo. I am going to specify\\n', 'the mapping as an argument to the\\n', 'parameter body, when you create\\n', \"an index, so far, we've only been specifying the document corresponding\\n\", \"to the index. But now I'm going to\\n\", 'create an index based on a new mapping that\\n', 'I want to generate. So this creates a\\n', \"brand new index, but that's not all that\\n\", 'I want here because I want to be able to go back\\n', 'and reindex the data. Just creating the index is\\n', 'not going to be good enough. I need to reindex the data. And in order to\\n', \"reindex the data, because I'm performing reindexing\\n\", 'I need to specify what is the source from which my data is coming\\n', 'from, the index. New York City restaurants\\n', \"is going to be the source. What is the destination index? That's going to be New\\n\", 'York City restaurants geo. And you also need to specify a scripted field\\n', \"where you're actually taking the new field by specifying what the\\n\", 'source of that field is, and using the specific\\n', 'syntax ctx._source, and then the name of\\n', 'the new field location. And then you need to\\n', 'configure an array. Your lat long values need\\n', 'to be part of an array. Longitude should come first, latitude should go next, similar to what you need to do. And you need to\\n', 'explicitly invoke the reindex method and re index the entire data by specifying this reindex dictionary as an\\n', \"argument to the body query. Once you do that, you'll\\n\", 'be able to access the geodata and run like\\n', 'geo query is on it. Any questions on how to create a new geo field from\\n', 'existing fields? Yeah. >> What is CTX? >> CTX is the format\\n', \"that you need to use. That's also coming from the operator\\n\", 'requirements as part of writing the\\n', 'script query.

That's a good question. I don't know an answer. I need to look that up\\n\", 'and give you an answer. So, this query hopefully should look very\\n', 'similar to you because we wrote this exact same query inside our MongoDB\\n', 'dataset as well. Find all the Airbnb\\n', 'listings within five kilometers of Central Park. That was the question\\n', \"that we answered there. Let's find all the inspected\\n\", 'restaurants within five kilometers of\\n', 'Central Park now. So since we have re\\n', 'indexed the data now to actually have\\n', 'a geo point field, you are going to be able to\\n', 'use geo distance operator, which is exactly the same as\\n', 'the operator in MongoDB and specify what the distances for your circle that\\n', \"you're trying to search, and the location of\\n\", \"your search point, which is going to be the latlong corresponding to Central Park, and it's going to\\n\", 'enable you to find all the inspected restaurants which are within five\\n', 'kilometers of Central Park, quite a few of them. As one would expect, Central Park is literally\\n', 'in the middle of Manhattan, which is full of restaurants. Any questions at all before\\n', \"we move on to Kibana? So I don't have much\\n\", 'to show on Kibana, but the very first thing\\n', 'that I want to show is go back to our Docker. So hopefully all of you remember that when we install\\n', 'Elasticsearch, we also install Kibana. You have two different Docker containers that are running. Elasticsearch is the\\n', 'one with Port 9,200. Kibana is the one\\n', 'with Port 5601. So as one might guess, we need to establish the SSH tunnel in order to\\n', 'be able to access Kibana.

You need to go to \"Advanced\". It is important that you\\n', \"do this because just like the New York City restaurants'\\n\", 'data did not have a geo point field neither\\n', 'does places.json. The only good thing is the coordinates are\\n', 'already inside an array. So instead of just\\n', 'having type as double, you could literally change\\n', 'the field type to geo point. And I believe Arianne\\n', 'has also asked you to change the name\\n', 'field to keyword type, so as to not perform\\n', 'full text search on it. So and then you do these\\n', 'things and go here, and you need to\\n', 'create an index name, for instance, places_madison. I already have this\\n', 'index, my bad. Places_mad. That is syndex. So it will go through these operations and create\\n', 'a data view for you. Once the data view is created, you can go into maps and\\n', 'Click on \"Add Layer\". That\\'s how you load the data.

For instance, we can\\n', 'apply the s operator on borough and only select\\n', 'the Manhattan restaurants. I think I have a typo. You may go back again. S operator Manhattan. Then Click on \"Add Filter\", that\\'ll filter just the\\n', \"Manhattan restaurants. And then there's one\\n\", \"question where you're asked to create a draw\\n\", 'distance circle. You need to Click on\\n', 'this \"Settings\" icon. Click on \"Draw Distance\\n', 'Area\", create a name.

Once I do that, I can\\n', 'create my distance around that by using\\n', \"just my mouse pointer, and then keep expanding. That's approximately 5.5\\n\", 'kilometer from Central Park.

            "['Kibana for people, and the other two, you can\\n', 'explore it if you want to. So the other two beats\\n', 'helps with data ingestion, otherwise, known as\\n', 'data collection, and Logstash helps with data aggregation and\\n', 'monitoring features. So the key factor with respect\\n', 'to Elasticsearch is that, it works with different\\n', 'types of data. So in MongoDB, we saw that we have\\n', 'really good support for semi-structured data, which could also include having a JSON field which\\n', \"contains textual content, although we didn't\\n\", 'quite cover how to do such process or operations\\n', \"within such text content. I'll just list the operator\\n\", \"later during today's lecture. So key difference between MongoDB and\\n\", \"Elasticsearch is that, it's so much more efficient\\n\", 'in terms of providing, indexing options for\\n', \"unstructured data. So which means that we're\\n\", 'going to be able to deal with different types of\\n', 'data including text, numeric, geospatial,\\n', 'and if you want, you could use it for\\n', 'structured data as well, but primarily\\n', 'Elasticsearch is used mainly for semi-structured\\n', \"data and unstructured data. So let's talk about use case\\n\", 'scenarios for Elasticsearch. First of all, it is\\n', 'definitely considered as a really good search engine\\n', 'for full text search, and also for other\\n', 'searches like application, website search, enterprise\\n', 'search, and so on. It is also really good for enterprises that\\n', 'deal with a lot of logged data or even data. Whenever you have, data in\\n', \"the form of logs or events, it's typically going\\n\", 'to be of text format. And Elasticsearch does\\n', 'a really good job of providing indexing into\\n', 'text format of data. And we have like a couple of other us case scenarios as well, which relate to, again, mainly\\n', 'enterprise applications, so infrastructure metrics\\n', 'and container monitoring, application performance\\n', 'monitoring, of course, you could do geospatial data\\n', 'analysis and visualization, the visualization\\n', 'part will be done using Kibana and\\n', 'not Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is also really good for security and\\n', 'business analytics, because it enables you to have\\n', 'a real time holistic view of all of the operations that occur within your enterprise\\n', \"application software. So in general, it's just\\n\", 'really good for enterprises, mainly because it\\n', 'enables correlation of all of these different\\n', 'types of data, like, logs and traces\\n', 'and things like that. Now, the key thing for\\n', 'you to know is that, Elasticsearch is\\n', 'implemented using Java. And the underlying\\n', 'search engine, which is Apache Lucene, is also implemented using Java. So you might encounter\\n', 'one or two things with respect to Java whenever\\n', \"you use Elasticsearch. Let's talk about\\n\", 'the key features. First of all, it has a\\n', 'distributed architecture, which is what enables us to\\n', 'support horizontal scaling. How exactly is the data stored? The data is partitioned into\\n', 'what are called as shards, and then the shards will be distributed across the\\n', \"nodes within the cluster. We'll talk about details of that later during the lecture. And do you have a really\\n\", 'easy way for you to be able to write code because of the availability\\n', 'of RESTful API, which enables us\\n', 'to interact with the data in the form\\n', 'of JSON structure, and the interaction\\n', 'itself will happen via HTTP or HTTPS request. The primary use case that I mentioned in the\\n', 'previous slide is going to be one\\n', 'of the key features, of course, like Elasticsearch, enables to perform\\n', 'full text search, and the underlying search\\n', 'engine is going to be another open source software\\n', 'called Apache Lucene, which has been around for longer than\\n', 'Elasticsearch, actually. So some aspects of MongoDB\\n', \"also use Apache Lucene. So that's something which\\n\", 'is a common factor between some parts of MongoDB and\\n', 'some parts of Elasticsearch. And you can perform\\n', 'any analysis, like simple text\\n', 'analysis or like, even come up with\\n', 'complex situations like, fuzzy searches, in\\n', 'terms of being able to use ranking with\\n', \"respect to fuzzy searches. It's a near real time search. Nothing is like\\n\", \"actually real time, so it's safer to say that\\n\", \"it's a near real time search. The key factor there, is that, you are going to\\n\", \"be able to support applications where up to date information is highly critical. Some more features, we saw that MongoDB's\\n\", 'main feature is that you do not have a\\n', 'schema that your data needs to conform to\\n', 'unless and until you actually define JSON schema\\n', 'using specific settings. Similar to that, Elasticsearch is also going to be schema free, which is ideal for being able to analyze semi-structured\\n', 'and unstructured data. So it does support\\n', 'explicit mappings, if you really want to, but in\\n', \"general, it's schema free, and it supports dynamic\\n\", 'indexing of new documents that get added to your enterprise\\n', \"application as time goes on, let's say, that you\\n\", \"have a new log, so you're going to\\n\", \"have a new document. So in a matter of seconds, you're going to be able to start searching within\\n\", 'the new document, because Elasticsearch supports\\n', 'near real time indexing. A couple of other features, like you can go through powerful\\n', 'aggregation operations, analytical queries to summarize and process large datasets. This is like a similar\\n', 'feature with respect to SQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch. And here is the key\\n', 'factor in terms of difference between\\n', 'MongoDB and Elasticsearch, Elasticsearch is\\n', \"highly scalable, so you can actually scale Elasticsearch implementation to petabyte scale deployments. That's not necessarily true\\n\", 'with MongoDB, unfortunately. So any questions about the features before we talk\\n', \"about deployment options? Let's talk about\\n\", 'deployment options. Just common terminology that\\n', 'you use whenever you have some single elastic\\n', 'search instance running is going to\\n', 'be a single node. So within a single node, you can run a single\\n', 'instance of elastic search. And just like with all\\n', \"other software applications that we've been using so far, you can either do\\n\", 'the installation on native hardware or on a\\n', 'virtual machine or within a container or you can run it on the Cloud to sense on\\n', \"where we'll be running. Hopefully, that's\\n\", \"not surprising. We'll be using docker containers to deploy elastic\\n\", 'search as well. So single node deployment is one way to deploy\\n', 'elastic search. Typically, Elasticsearch\\n', \"is deployed as a cluster of nodes. And as I mentioned, because it is highly scalable, you'll be able to\\n\", 'deploy hundreds of nodes within a single cluster. And Elasticsearch\\n', 'will be running within each of those\\n', \"cluster of nodes. So just like how you can have a cluster that's like local to a specific geography,\\n\", 'for instance, you can create the\\n', 'virtual machines in GCP, using different locations where Google has a data center, you can choose to have those\\n', 'locations either within a single geographic country or you could deploy it across\\n', 'multiple countries. This actually typically\\n', 'depends on whether or not you want your data to have geographically\\n', 'separated replication. And another factor that usually governs\\n', \"people's design in terms of how to\\n\", 'create clusters would be to consider where your\\n', 'users are coming from. If your user base is mainly\\n', \"within the United States, probably it'll be a\\n\", 'good idea to have all of your nodes in the\\n', 'US, as opposed to that, if you have a global market, then it makes sense to have, like parts of your nodes in\\n', 'various locations where you have the market associated\\n', 'with your application product. >> So when you have\\n', 'global deployments, not only do you have a\\n', 'cross-cluster interaction, you could also use the global deployment to go through cross-cluster\\n', 'replication. That is your data shards can be split across geographically\\n', 'separated nodes. First of all, Elasticsearch\\n', 'is a document store, which is why I mentioned\\n', 'earlier during the lecture, it would probably\\n', \"make you wonder, why in the world are we learning about the new document store? Why couldn't we\\n\", \"just use MongoDB, which is also a document store? Let's answer that question\\n\", 'in a couple of slides. Before that, just a quick review of what a\\n', 'document store is. Your data is stored in\\n', \"the form of documents. In case of Elasticsearch, you're going to have a\\n\", 'distributed document store. A document is nothing but a serialized JSON object\\n', 'that is going to be stored in Elasticsearch along\\n', 'with a unique document ID. For example, I have a simple\\n', 'example of a JSON object, which is going to get stored in Elasticsearch as a document. The JSON formatting is going to be exactly the same\\n', \"as what you used with MongoDB if you're doing analysis of JSON data using\\n\", 'Elasticsearch. So here is a question. How can we represent\\n', 'unstructured data using JSON? Here is the key thing with JSON. You can take any data\\n', 'and convert that into a JSON format very easily. You can come up with\\n', 'some descriptive fields. For example, I\\n', 'have a table here. Not the best format to represent various blog post information like what is the title\\n', 'of the blog post, when was it published iand\\n', 'details of the author, and the actual textual\\n', 'content of the blog post. You can very easily take\\n', \"such unstructured data, even though it's\\n\", \"represented as tables here, we all know that's not\\n\", \"how blog posts work. So it's very easy\\n\", 'for you to take unstructured data like a\\n', 'blog post and convert that into a JSON format by coming up with appropriate\\n', 'field value pairs. For instance, take\\n', \"individual aspects of the unstructured data and come up with the fields to represent the associated data. So why elastic search? Let's answer this question\\n\", 'before we move on to the details associated with how exactly indexing works. So why not use MongoDB? Let me, first of all, tell you what kind of text search\\n', 'features that you have in MongoDB\\n', \"because we didn't quite go through such examples. So Here is the key limitation\\n\", 'with respect to MongoDB. You can only have single text index per\\n', 'MongoDB collection. And that particular\\n', 'text index can be based on multiple\\n', 'field values. Hopefully, all of you remember\\n', 'how to create an index. I showed you an\\n', 'example of how to create an index using\\n', 'geospatial data. You select a field and then associate a specific\\n', 'index type with it. You can do something\\n', 'similar with text field or a combination\\n', 'of text fields as well, but the limitation is\\n', 'that you could only have a single text\\n', 'index per collection. So which means that all of your search operations are going to be limited to the data associated with whatever\\n', 'field your index corresponds to or the set of fields that particular\\n', \"index corresponds to. Again, that's the downside. But we all know that\\n\", 'MongoDB is schemaless, which means that it can\\n', \"dynamically index documents, but here's the key thing with respect to being able\\n\", 'to index new documents. You can only do that after\\n', 'you do the index creation. Unlike that, Elasticsearch\\n', 'is able to create dynamic indices for\\n', \"documents for which you don't even have specific\\n\", \"indices created. so let's talk about\\n\", 'what kind of operator enables you to perform\\n', \"text search in MongoDB. It's the dollar text operator. I do not expect you\\n\", \"to know examples of this because I don't plan to cover it this\\n\", \"semester at least. If you're curious,\\n\", 'you can explore how the dollar text operator works. So MongoDB text search features include things like exact phrase and\\n', 'case-insensitive match. You can also do things\\n', 'like stemming and stopping words and\\n', 'basic Boolean logic of find all the searches\\n', \"that don't match with something like inverse\\n\", 'search and things like that. But it is still pretty limited because of\\n', 'the fact that you can only have single index\\n', \"on a single collection. So let's talk about why\\n\", 'Elasticsearch is better. Now that we know what kind of search techniques you\\n', 'can use for MongoDB. So Elasticsearch is so much\\n', 'better because it uses an inverted index that is based on the search engine\\n', 'implementation, open-source implementation,\\n', 'Apache Lucene. So it is highly optimized for large-scale and\\n', 'high-performance searches. Sorry about the text\\n', \"getting cut off there. I'll fix that after the lecture. So as I mentioned, Elasticsearch can perform dynamic field\\n\", 'indexing., that is, you do not have any need for\\n', 'predefined text indices. As opposed to that, you can\\n', 'just add in a new document, and within a matter of seconds, you should be able to start searching within\\n', 'the new document. And unlike MongoDB, which\\n', 'expects you to specify a field or a set of\\n', 'fields based on which you perform the index indexing, in Elasticsearch, all of the fields are\\n', 'automatically indexed. And also, it supports\\n', 'multiple index types, like keyword-based index,\\n', \"text-based index, and so on. I'm still going to talk about more indexing features with\\n\", 'respect to Elasticsearch. So the query language\\n', 'enables you to perform full-text search and do things like fine-tuned\\n', 'full-text searches, exact phrase matching, which\\n', 'also MongoDB supports. But it also supports things\\n', 'like fuzzy matching, wildcard searches, and\\n', 'proximity searches. Fuzzy matching is the\\n', \"scenario when you, let's say, that misspell a word that\\n\", \"you're trying to search for or you have minor variances in your search term as opposed\\n\", 'to your target result terms. So Elasticsearch\\n', 'supports fuzzy matching. It also supports\\n', \"complex Boolean logic, a couple of query operators that we'll be learning\\n\", 'are going to be matched, should, should not, and so on. Here is the underlying\\n', 'factor which makes elastic search so much\\n', 'better than MongoDB. So the scoring technique\\n', 'in MongoDB is very simple in terms of scoring\\n', \"the search results. It's not a complex algorithm. You can teach yourself how\\n\", 'to do that if you want to. As opposed to that, the underlying scoring\\n', 'and boosting algorithm in Elasticsearch is BM25, which is the most famous\\n', 'scoring algorithm that majority of the\\n', 'search-based applications use. So because of the fact that you have a highly sophisticated\\n', \"scoring mechanism, you're going to be\\n\", 'able to customize your ranking based\\n', 'on specific fields. If you want to, depends on\\n', 'your application scenario. And also, you can use various\\n', 'boost factors and like custom scoring logic\\n', 'to dictate how exactly the ranking mechanism will work for your\\n', \"individual application. And as I've mentioned before, you also have support for\\n\", 'geographic search and also nested document search\\n', \"using Elasticsearch. Let's talk about indexing\\n\", 'in Elasticsearch. First of all,\\n', 'documents are indexed into an index,\\n', 'might be confusing. Hopefully, once I show a\\n', \"couple of visualizations, it'll be quite clear. What is an index? An index is a logical way of grouping data that are similar. You can think of an index as an optimization for the\\n\", \"collection of the documents. Let me give you an example. Let's say that your cluster\\n\", 'contains a lot of log data. For example, the indices associated with the log\\n', 'data can be thought of organizing the data based on the time or if you can think of various data types being stored within your unstructured data, the indices can be\\n', 'thought of to be an organization mechanism to arrange your data based\\n', \"on various data types. Let's consider a specific\\n\", \"scenario of logs. For instance, let's say\\n\", 'that you have daily logs, you can think of having\\n', 'an index per day. You can have one index\\n', \"for Monday's log, another index for\\n\", \"Tuesday's log, and so on. So index is stored within\\n\", 'an Elasticsearch node. It can either be stored within a single node within the\\n', 'cluster, for instance, within just Node 1, or indices can span\\n', 'across entire cluster. So when indices span\\n', 'across entire cluster, the documents stored within those indices are typically\\n', 'distributed across the nodes. Specifically, how do\\n', 'we store documents? The documents are stored\\n', 'in the form of shards. So the index distributes the\\n', 'documents associated with the indices over\\n', \"one or more shards. And each shard is going to be an instant of Apache Lucene, and it's going to\\n\", 'contain all the data of any one document associated\\n', 'with that particular index. So this particular index\\n', 'has five different shards. So approximately every shard\\n', 'is going to be storing about 20% of the documents associated with that\\n', 'particular index. Any questions on how\\n', 'index and shards work? What if one of the\\n', 'node goes down? What happens to\\n', 'your data that is stored as shards within\\n', 'that particular node? So here is the thing. Elasticsearch supports\\n', 'replication by offering support with two\\n', 'different types of shards. You have two configurations\\n', 'with shards. It can either be\\n', 'a primary shard, or it can be a replica shard. The primary shard, as\\n', 'the name suggests, is going to be the original\\n', 'shard associated with the data document that is\\n', 'being indexed by that index. The replica shard are going\\n', \"to be exact same copies, excepting that they're\\n\", \"just going to be backup for the primary shard. For example, let's say that you have two different\\n\", 'shards here. So for Shard 0, the primary is\\n', 'going to be Node 1 and actually three different\\n', \"shards, my apologies. I have 0, 1, and 2 here, don't I? Shard 0, primary is\\n\", \"going to be Node 1, whereas Shard 0's replica\\n\", \"is going to be Node 3. Similarly, Shard 1's primary\\n\", \"is going to be Node 2, Shard 1's, replica is going\\n\", 'to be Node 1, and so on. So with replication, what do you do when there is a loss of connectivity with a node inside your\\n', \"Elasticsearch cluster? It's going to be simple enough. What happens when you do that is that whatever nodes\\n\", 'are available, if you only have\\n', \"replica shard there, that's going to\\n\", 'become the primary. For instance, Node 1 went down. Node 1 was previously\\n', 'the primary for Shard 0, and the replica shard\\n', \"for zero was in Node 3. Now Node 3's copy of the Shard 0 is going\\n\", \"to become primary. But that's not where we stop in Elasticsearch,\\n\", 'replication support. As soon as the primary node associated with a\\n', 'shard goes down, the minute you convert the replica shard\\n', \"into a primary shard, it's going to make sure that another replica gets created. So Node 3 is going to\\n\", 'go ahead and create a shard replica\\n', 'for Shard 0 here. Not only that, you have other\\n', 'scenarios here as well. So you have Shard 1\\n', \"primarily stored in Node 2. You don't have a\\n\", 'backup for Shard 1. The replica was\\n', 'previously on Node 2. Now Node 2 is going to\\n', 'make sure that it creates a replica shard for\\n', \"Shard 1 as well. So it's not just about the primary shards\\n\", 'getting replicated. You also make sure that if the primary is active and\\n', \"you don't have a replica, you replicate that as well. So here are trade-offs\\n\", 'for you to consider with respect to this\\n', 'whole replication setter. First of all, this replication replication\\n', 'setter enables you to create a highly scalable system in terms of both write\\n', 'and read scalability. Of course, reads also become\\n', \"more reliable because you're always going to have\\n\", 'a backup for your data. But the downside of doing all of this\\n', 'replication, actually, this is a common downside, no matter what system\\n', 'that you talk about here. The downside of having data\\n', 'replicated is going to be that you need more resources,\\n', \"more replica shards, would obviously mean that you'd need more computing resources, typically more\\n\", 'storage, more CPU, more memory to do all\\n', 'of the processing. So is there a better way for us to go through this\\n', 'deployment scenario? Yes, you can take the replica\\n', 'shards and deploy them on Cloud in simplistic object\\n', 'based storage environments. Hopefully, all of you have\\n', 'heard of Amazon S3 storage. It gives you, like the bare\\n', 'metal storage opportunity to dump your data in\\n', 'the form of objects. And you have, similar\\n', 'such Cloud offerings, not software, my apology. Similar such Cloud\\n', 'offerings from Azure and also from\\n', \"Google Cloud Storage. There'll be minor differences, but in terms of how exactly\\n\", 'the object is defined, but for all practical purposes, they work in a similar way. So this would ensure\\n', 'that we reduce the storage cost incurred by our Elasticsearch deployment\\n', \"at least by half. That's because only\\n\", 'the primary shards are on your Elasticsearch nodes. And whenever a node goes down, then you have the data\\n', 'backed up on Cloud, and unless an [inaudible]\\n', \"that happens, you're not quite going to be retrieving the data\\n\", 'from the Cloud. Of course, you could also use this exact same mechanism to store all of your\\n', 'primary shards as well on Cloud and make sure\\n', \"that you don't use any local SSD or any\\n\", 'hard disk or SSD, whatever storage device that your computing cluster has for storing the data aspect\\n', 'of things at all. The downside of storing your primary shards on Cloud\\n', 'obviously is going to be the additional network\\n', \"overhead that you'll have to incur every time you need to do data\\n\", 'analysis or processing. So the final thing\\n', 'that I want to talk about is the fact that Elasticsearch\\n', \"supports RESTful API. You're going to be able to\\n\", 'use the RESTful APIs to communicate with the cluster\\n', 'over either HTTP or HTTPS. And the APIs enable you to write your own applications\\n', \"in any language. Surprise, we're not going to be writing it in any other\\n\", \"language but Python. I'm just kidding. So\\n\", \"you'll be able to use the language-specific line to interact with Elasticsearch, and you could use any of the language native\\n\", 'features while having support for\\n', 'Elasticsearch. Any questions at all about\\n', 'intro for Elasticsearch? >> So I usually\\n', 'have the deployment associated with the lecture inside the lecture\\n', \"snippet files. I don't have it there today\\n\", 'for a specific reason because I want all\\n', 'of you to for sure, go through project\\n', \"P4's description and follow the steps from\\n\", \"project P4's description. So first of all, just\\n\", 'give me one minute. I am going to log\\n', 'into my GCP console. And there is a reason\\n', \"I'm doing that. The very first thing that\\n\", \"you're going to do after today's lecture is to upgrade your virtual machine\\n\", \"to e2- medium. This is an essential step. I cannot insist this enough. You're not going to be able to run Elasticsearch if you\\n\", \"don't upgrade your VM. So make absolutely sure that you're saving all of\\n\", 'your notebook files. And also I would\\n', 'recommend you to do this after you have wrapped\\n', 'up project P3, running other Docker containers, while attempting to install\\n', 'Elasticsearch is most definitely going to make Elasticsearch\\n', 'installation to fail. And Elasticsearch is not\\n', 'a simple installation. So if it fails, rather than break your head\\n', 'on how to fix the issue, I would just recommend\\n', \"you to provision a new VM. And I'm not kidding. As you can see, I messed up my installation so I\\n\", 'have two different VMs. So I know that this\\n', \"is an easier way out so that's what I did rather\\n\", \"than trying to fix my VM. So you don't have to essentially provision a new VM\\n\", 'of e2-medium type. There is a helpful tutorial\\n', \"here that you can follow along with to ensure that you're able to upgrade\\n\", \"your existing VM, assuming that you don't have too many issues with\\n\", 'your existing VM. Before you do any of\\n', 'the upgrade steps, make absolutely sure to stop and remove all of the existing\\n', \"running container, do perfect Docker cleanup. Remove all the images as well. If you haven't already\\n\", 'removed the MySQL image, do that and remove that along\\n', 'with Mongo image as well. Also, clean up your storage\\n', 'space on your desk. I know for a fact that\\n', 'many of the students have multiple copies of\\n', \"various datasets that you've been\\n\", 'analyzing so far. Please make sure\\n', 'to remove all of the extra unnecessary\\n', \"data files because all of the storage that you have is going to come in handy while installing Elasticsearch, and we'll continue to\\n\", 'have the sizes 25 GB, should be sufficient\\n', 'enough for you to be able to install and work\\n', 'with Elasticsearch. Any questions at all\\n', 'about this step. I want to make absolutely\\n', 'sure that I convey to all of you that you must\\n', \"upgrade your VM. So once you upgrade your VM, you're most definitely going\\n\", 'to have a new IP address. I highly doubt whether you get the same IP address after\\n', 'changing the VM type. So give me a second. This is what happens when you have a brand new\\n', \"virtual machine. I don't have htop\\n\", 'installed, wait. Or am I on my laptop? My apologies. Wait. Htop\\n', 'comes by default on Linux. So if you run htop\\n', 'within the new VM, you should be able\\n', 'to see 4 GB worth of memory as opposed to\\n', 'seeing closer to 2 GB. 4 GB RAM is a\\n', 'fundamental requirement to make sure that Elasticsearch\\n', 'actually works well, which is why we are\\n', \"upgrading at this point, and we're going\\n\", 'to continue using e2-medium for the rest\\n', 'of this semester. Now, with respect to the setup, you need to run this\\n', 'command and when you are successfully done\\n', 'running this command, you need to make absolutely sure that you store a\\n', 'bunch of things. So I want to make sure that that also comes across really well\\n', 'when we go through this. So at the end of the\\n', 'output of the command, the username always is\\n', 'going to be elastic, and the format might\\n', \"be slightly different, when compared to the screenshot, but you'll see\\n\", 'similar information. So you have your\\n', \"elastic username, and you'll be\\n\", 'provided a password, make sure to store that password along with this API\\n', \"key for Elasticsearch. You'd need all of\\n\", \"that information. I'm fine with using Orion's screenshot here\\n\", 'to project things here, because all of our environment\\n', 'are within containers. So once he gets rid of\\n', \"the Docker container, these API keys aren't\\n\", 'really significant, so I feel okay about\\n', 'sharing that part. So once you do that, that will run a Docker cluster which contains two different\\n', 'Docker containers. Here is the very first\\n', \"time that we're going to be using two different\\n\", 'Docker containers. So let me go ahead\\n', 'and show you that. I might have to do some cleanup. Just give me a few minutes here to ensure that I am\\n', \"able to do clean up. My bad. I'll leave the\\n\", 'other one as such. So when you install the\\n', \"Elasticsearch successfully. Actually, give me a second. I'm going to show\\n\", 'you what happens. So I do the installation\\n', 'on my home directory, which is where I would\\n', 'recommend you to do the installation because when\\n', \"you do the installation, that's going to create\\n\", 'a new directory called elastic-start-local, you can CD into that directory, and that will have\\n', \"a bunch of files. In case you're curious, I don't expect any of you to\\n\", 'know how to write Yml files. Yml files enable you to create configuration for a cluster of nodes that you want to launch\\n', 'or provision using Docker. Yml is the syntax for you to provision more than\\n', 'one Docker container. Hopefully, all of you will\\n', 'remember from early part of the semester that Docker file is a configuration for a single Docker container and Yml file is a configuration for a\\n', 'cluster of Docker containers. And you can either have\\n', 'your Yml file work with custom Docker files by\\n', 'creating your own Docker file. Or you could just use your Docker images\\n', \"from docker.hub.com, and that will work as well. With respect to Elasticsearch, we're going to be using\\n\", 'the image from the Hub. So specifically, the image\\n', 'is going to come from docker.elastic.com and\\n', 'then Elasticsearch, and then Elasticsearch\\n', 'with a local version. So if you want, you can search\\n', 'for the tag image within this Docker Yml file and that will lead you to realize how many Docker containers this particular Yml file\\n', 'is going to be launching. The first one is going\\n', 'to be for Elasticsearch. The next one is going\\n', 'to be for Kibana. And then you also have\\n', \"one for Kibana settings, which terminates right after it's done performing\\n\", 'the necessary settings, which is why I left this Kibana setting Docker\\n', 'container over here. The couple of other\\n', 'stale containers that I terminated as well, comes from the\\n', 'Elasticsearch installation, just that they get launched, do their tasks, and then\\n', \"they'll be done after that. So if you're curious, you can explore the port\\n\", 'forwarding options that show up within the ports\\n', 'output inside Docker PS. As one might guess, Kibana is going to\\n', 'be using Port 5601, and Elasticsearch is going\\n', 'to be using Port 9,200. Any questions at all about\\n', \"how to set up Elasticsearch? You'd also want to install the Python module for Elasticsearch by doing pip\\n\", \"3 install Elasticsearch. And I've done all of this. So I'm going to go\\n\", 'back to where I was. Before I move on\\n', 'to the notebook, I just want to make sure that\\n', \"all of you are fine with whatever we've covered so far in terms of Elasticsearch\\n\", 'installation. Any questions at all? I am going to go ahead and\\n', 'launch a Jupyter Notebook. Wait, give me a second. I already have a Jupyter\\n', \"Notebook connection. I don't need any one. So for today's lecture, I'm just going to go through simplistic code here which I\\n\", \"believe I've already pushed. Give me a second. I'm just going to kernel\\n\", \"restart and clear output. Later on Monday's lecture, I'll show you how to actually\\n\", 'load the JSON files and maybe a couple of text file\\n', \"data into Elasticsearch. But for now, I'm just going\\n\", \"to show you basic things. I have a simple JSON example. We're not going\\n\", \"to be doing much. I had a feeling we won't\\n\", 'have enough time to actually write code\\n', \"to do the indexing. So all that I'm going to show in today's lecture is how to establish the connection\\n\", 'to Elasticsearch, and also how to use the\\n', 'client object instance to do simple basic things\\n', 'like creating an index, deleting an index, and so on. So first of all, let me run the cell containing\\n', 'the import statements. For the purpose of\\n', \"today's lecture, we're only going to be using the second import statement from Elasticsearch module\\n\", 'that hopefully, all of you will get installed\\n', \"after today's lecture. I'm going to be importing\\n\", \"Elasticsearch and helpers. We're only going to be using\\n\", 'Elasticsearch for now. Give me a second.\\n', \"I'll go back to the docker ps -a output. Like I mentioned, from\\n\", 'the Docker output, Elasticsearch is going to\\n', 'be listening on Port 9,200. So Elasticsearch is\\n', 'going to enable you to establish a client\\n', 'connection when you specify HTTP: and then //localhost to indicate\\n', 'the look back IP address, and then, 9,200 to\\n', 'specify the port itself. Along with the\\n', 'connection information, you also need to specify\\n', \"basic authentication. Go back to P4's screenshot. Remember the password\\n\", 'that I asked you to save, the password corresponding\\n', \"to the username elastic? That's going to be the password\\n\", 'that you need to type in here as part of the\\n', 'basic authentication. Basic authentication\\n', 'parameter takes a tuple as an argument. The first entry within the tuple is going\\n', \"to be the username, elastic, that's going to\\n\", 'be common for everyone. And my password is this one, all of you will have\\n', 'your own password. This enables you to set\\n', 'up a client connection. The very first thing\\n', 'that you would need to usually do is to\\n', 'make absolutely sure that you are able to verify that Elasticsearch cluster\\n', 'is running correctly. So info is the method that\\n', 'enables you to do that. This is a dead giveaway\\n', \"for question one's answer. So technically, after\\n\", \"today's lecture, you can get started do the installation and\\n\", 'finish Question 1. The Elasticsearch version\\n', 'is going to be 8.15.3. As I mentioned, somewhere\\n', 'between seven and eight, the Elasticsearch implementation\\n', \"became proprietary, and then, now it's\\n\", \"back to open source. Good for us. It's\\n\", 'back to open source. So this enables you to\\n', \"take a look at details associated with the cluster. Here, it's going to\\n\", 'be a Docker cluster, and the build type is\\n', 'going to be Docker and you have other\\n', 'specific details when exactly this\\n', 'particular build was created date 2024, October 9th, quite recent. Any questions on how to\\n', \"establish the connection? So I'm just going to show\\n\", \"two other simple examples. How do you create an index? How do you delete an index? Often you're going to be\\n\", 'doing kernel restart run all. I felt like I showed how\\n', 'to drop a database in MongoDB quite late into\\n', \"the lecture series. I don't want to do that\\n\", \"again with Elasticsearch, so I'm going to make\\n\", \"sure to show it right at the first lecture. So my data directory is going to be just simply data itself. You'll have something\\n\", 'similar when you create your GitHub class room\\n', \"private repository. So how do you create indices? You're going to be using client object\\n\", 'instance reference, and then saying.indices, the method name is\\n', \"going to be create, and you're going to have to\\n\", \"configure the index name. For instance, I'm\\n\", 'going to configure the index name as New\\n', 'York City restaurants. Similar to how we used an\\n', 'inspection data in MongoDB, I have a similar JSON for\\n', \"Elasticsearch as well. And before next lecture, I'll add in more data files. So this is going to be the\\n\", \"response object instance. You're going to get an object\\n\", \"API response and I believe, often you'll have to save the response object instance into a particular JSON format, like how Orion expects you to. And similar to the\\n\", 'create method, you have the delete method, which enables you to delete the index that you just created. One thing that I want to highlight is the\\n', 'deadline of project P4. The deadline is going to be October 28th due to\\n', 'two specific reasons. I want to make sure\\n', \"that we keep up with our plan deadlines. So I know that we've\\n\", 'been falling behind a little bit with P2 and P3. P4 is going to enable us\\n', \"to do a catch up of that. If you've already gotten a\\n\", 'chance to scroll through P4, you would have noticed that\\n', 'P4 only has 10 questions. Again, due to two reasons. I want to keep the difficulty of this project a little bit low because P5 is going\\n', 'to be challenging. So you have a little\\n', 'bit of breathing space. Also, raw data is not\\n', 'that easy to handle, so this project is going\\n', 'to be relatively easier. Thank you for the extra minute. I will see all of you on Monday.']\n",
            "['>> Hello, everyone. We are\\n', 'going to start with top hat, mainly because I feel\\n', \"like I'll forget top hat today if I\\n\", \"don't do it now. Top hat is a check in question, so there is no correct answer, but I would like to know\\n\", 'where the students are. So please help me,\\n', 'get to know that. Majority of you are done, that makes me feel happy. Although this is definitely not a representative of\\n', 'the entire class. We apparently only have less\\n', \"than half of the class here. I understand it's the\\n\", 'lecture after the midterm. People want to take a break. So hopefully, this is actually representative of the rest of the\\n', \"people as well. So we're going to switch topics, and move on to learning about a brand new NoSQL database\\n\", 'called Elasticsearch. And later during\\n', \"today's lecture, I'll tell you why we're actually going to be\\n\", 'learning Elasticsearch and actually not MongoDB to do the text search on\\n', \"unstructured data. So few learning objectives here, we're going to talk\\n\", \"about use case scenarios for Elasticsearch, and we'll be discussing what are the key features\\n\", 'of Elasticsearch? What deployment\\n', \"options that you have, and what are the terminologies associated with the deployments? And we'll spend a couple of slides talking\\n\", 'about the differences between MongoDB\\n', \"and Elasticsearch in the context of text search. And finally, we'll learn what exactly is meant\\n\", \"by indexing and also the term shards. Question? >> [inaudible]. >> I did. Let's see\\n\", \"if I can fix it. I am in the right slide. Oh , what's wrong? Give me a minute. I am going to try and save\\n\", 'this somewhere else. Maybe inside my tool back here. This is, for sure, the\\n', \"correct one, I think. It'll take a few minutes for\\n\", 'the PDF file to get pushed, but it should happen, hopefully, in the next\\n', 'five ish or so minutes. So what exactly\\n', 'is Elasticsearch? Elasticsearch is\\n', 'a near real time and highly scalable search\\n', 'and analytics engine, which offers an easy way for you to interact with it by\\n', 'providing a RESTful API, just like how you had a\\n', 'similar API from MongoDB. So similar to how MongoDB, NoSQL database offers\\n', 'horizontal scalability, so does Elasticsearch,\\n', 'hopefully, all of you remember what\\n', 'horizontal scalability is. So otherwise, refer\\n', 'to as scaling out. Whenever you add new\\n', \"computing machines to form a cluster of machines, that's when you're achieving\\n\", \"horizontal scalability. We'll go through a\\n\", 'couple of deployment scenarios which talk about horizontal scalability later\\n', 'when we cover the slides. So first of all,\\n', 'Elasticsearch is part of what is called\\n', 'as Elastic Stack. Just in case if you\\n', 'were to Google that, you might end up with search results that\\n', 'involve the term ELK stack? It was previously\\n', 'known as ELK stack. There is a lot of drama\\n', 'associated with Elasticsearch. At one point, they\\n', 'moved from having it as open source and then\\n', \"proprietary software, and somebody pulled some tricks, and now it's back\\n\", 'to open source. Hopefully, it will remain to be an open source. Here\\n', \"is the key thing. How many of you have used Uber? Most of you in here. I'll raise my hand\\n\", \"because I have, as well. Probably you don't know this. The search engine behind Uber\\n\", \"is actually Elasticsearch. A lot of people don't\\n\", 'know that a lot of search-based platforms\\n', \"mainly use Elasticsearch, but they don't know that the back end is actually\\n\", \"implemented using Elasticsearch. That's how good\\n\", 'Elasticsearch is. We all know that\\n', \"Uber search is good, that's why we keep using Uber. Otherwise, we would be angry customers if\\n\", \"the search doesn't really work and provide us\\n\", 'really fast and quick results. So along with Elasticsearch, which is mainly intended\\n', 'for search and indexing, you have other software\\n', 'associated with elastic stack, which are beats,\\n', \"Logstash and Kibana. We'll be learning two out\\n\", \"of these four things. We're going to be using Elasticsearch and\\n\"]\n",
            "['that will be very handy. Let me go ahead and\\n', 'clear my screen. Other command is du, which stands for\\n', \"disc utilization that's going to\\n\", 'tell you which file or folder occupies what kind of space within your\\n', 'disk over here. For example, if I wanted a summarized version instead\\n', 'of just this full output, I can use the option\\n', 'or the flag s, which stands for summary. Let me also add in the\\n', \"human readable version. So I'm going to say du -sh, the current working directory, which is my home directory doesn't occupy much\\n\", \"space by itself. It's only just 2 MB. So my 3 GB of disc utilization is coming\\n\", \"from somewhere else. So let's say that instead\\n\", 'of saying du -sh, if I wanted to have a list of all the usage of the files and directories within the current\\n', 'working directory, I can do that by typing a forward slash and\\n', 'then an asterix, which indicates a file card. I currently have\\n', 'three directories within the current\\n', 'working directory. I move the files around\\n', \"that I've been creating for the past few lectures\\n\", 'in order to make sure that I have a\\n', 'directory hierarchy. So between those\\n', 'three directories, you can see the disk utilization for each of them over here. Any quizions about df or du? The last shell command\\n', \"that I'm going to show you is going to enable you to\\n\", 'debug network connections. Majority of the\\n', 'software applications are going to be running some kind of process associated with a\\n', \"specific port number. So often you'd want\\n\", 'to figure out, which process is taking up\\n', 'this particular port number X. So the command that is going to aid you to figure out details is something called lsof\\n', 'stands for list open files, files and quotation\\n', 'because lsof actually enables you to take a look at\\n', 'network connection details. In Unix, almost everything is thought of as a file,\\n', \"including network connection. So that's going to list all the currently active\\n\", 'network connections for you. So if you repeat the\\n', \"command with Sudo, that's going to give\\n\", 'you even more details. Let me introduce specific\\n', \"options, which are super handy. Often you'd want to just take\\n\", 'a look at TCP connections. Majority of the applications\\n', 'use TCP connections. So the flag that you need to specify specific\\n', 'connection is I.

So let's actually first get\\n\", 'started with the slides. Meanwhile, please\\n', 'set up Top Hat. So Docker is going to be one common deployment\\n', \"tool that you'll be using throughout the course\\n\", \"of the semester for majority of the projects. We'll learn why Docker is going to be super\\n\", \"handy for us shortly. Let's quickly go over\\n\", \"the learning objectives for the Docker topic. We're going to learn how to use existing docker images\\n\", 'to launch containers. Then we will also\\n', 'learn how to define our own docker images,\\n', 'custom images, using a file format\\n', 'called Docker file, which has a simplistic\\n', 'language associated with it. And we will also learn\\n', 'Docker commands, which will help us troubleshoot common issues while\\n', \"running Docker containers. Let's first get\\n\", 'started by talking about what exactly\\n', 'is virtualization. Virtualization is this illusion\\n', 'that you have access to your own private resources\\n', 'provided by the software while you actually do not have private access to all\\n', 'of those resources. And resources can mean\\n', 'four different things. Typically, in the world of\\n', \"computer science that's going to be compute\\n\", 'CPU or memory, otherwise known as RAM. And then you have disk, also known as boot\\n', 'disk sometimes, and then you have\\n', 'the fourth option, which is networking\\n', \"network connections. So we're going to focus on two different types\\n\", 'of virtualizations. There are so many\\n', 'different types of virtualizations out there. The first one, which all of\\n', 'you have actually been using for a week now is\\n', 'hardware virtualization, aka, virtual machines. So what exactly do I mean\\n', 'by hardware virtualization? This is a hardware laptop, and this runs a native\\n', 'operating system, which is MacOS on it. So this is my own device. Nobody else gets to use the four resources on this\\n', 'particular hardware machine. As opposed to that, Cloud is an environment where\\n', 'you can have access to many different physical\\n', 'hardware machines by paying to set up\\n', \"virtual machines. So you'll have some form of physical machine with physical\\n\", \"resources, for example, let's say that you have a\\n\", 'physical machine which contains 16 GB worth of RAM\\n', 'and eight CPU cores, sounds much better than\\n', 'the virtual machine that we have provisioned\\n', \"for all of us. On top of this physical machine, you'll be able to provision any number of virtual machines. Notice that the resources\\n\", 'are actually not exclusively associated with any of the virtual machines.\\n', 'What do I mean by that? Even though there is 16 GB total RAM on\\n', 'this physical machine. Notice that the VMs have\\n', 'been allocated 8 GB, 6 GB and 8 GB worth of RAM. How does this actually work? Hopefully, all of you have heard of the term overcommitting. If you have ever\\n', 'flown somewhere, it is likely that you\\n', 'would have heard of a story from either one of your friends\\n', 'or maybe yourself, that the airline\\n', 'overbooked your flight. What does it mean by\\n', 'overbooking a flight? A flight has physical\\n', 'number of seats, like, for instance, this lecture hall has\\n', 'physical number of seats. If I let in more number of people than the number of seats, somebody will have to stand. Unfortunately, you can stand\\n', 'and travel on a flight. So which means that somebody\\n', 'needs to be kicked out of the a roster of people\\n', 'flying on that airplane. Something similar\\n', 'is always done with the physical machines owned\\n', 'by Cloud service providers. Large Cloud service providers, hire statisticians who\\n', 'can help them figure out how they can\\n', 'effectively overcome it. If you do it well enough, you will end up not pissing off your customers,\\n', 'because, like, if you overcome it a lot, some of them might not be able\\n', 'to access their resources that you promise them that\\n', \"they will be able to access. So that's to do with\\n\", \"virtualization. That's how Cloud became\\n\", 'a really big thing. So we rent virtual\\n', 'machines as users of the physical hardware provided by Cloud\\n', 'service providers. VMs that rent rarely use all\\n', 'of the allocated resources. I just now showed\\n', \"you that I'm barely using my CPU on my GCPVM, which Google has generously allowed me to rent by\\n\", 'giving me credits. So we know that not all of the resources allocated to a\\n', \"VM is going to be utilized. Having that in mind, here is a question. Can't we just, like, keep provisioning virtual\\n\", 'machines whenever we want to deploy a new\\n', 'application program? Here is going to be the\\n', 'pain point of that. Each of these\\n', 'virtual machines can have its own version of\\n', 'the operating system, for example, this one\\n', 'has open too 22.4. This one has Windows, and so on. You can even have\\n', \"specific versions of individual operating systems. It's going to be a pain for you to keep figuring\\n\", 'out how to deploy various application programs into individual\\n', \"operating systems. So that's going to cause a lot of slowing down with respect to development process. And often, the operating\\n\", \"systems are unaware that they're being run on the virtual machine.\\n\", 'What do I mean by that? You have nearly the same version of the operating\\n', 'system being run as a virtual machine as opposed\\n', 'to the one being run as the native operating system on any kind of\\n', 'physical hardware. So how do we overcome\\n', \"this problem of, having to worry about deploying various application programs on different operating system? That's where the second type of virtualization is going\\n\", \"to come in handy. That's to do with Docker. The second kind\\n\", 'of virtualization is something called as\\n', 'virtual operating system, otherwise known as Containers. So Containers are\\n', 'lightweight versions of the operating systems, which can be deployed on\\n', \"top of a virtual machine, and you'll be very easily able\\n\", 'to deploy whatever version of software application\\n', 'you want within the Container for a\\n', \"specific requirement. And let's say that for\\n\", 'an alternate scenario, you need a totally\\n', 'different software version. You can throw out the\\n', 'previous Container and provision a\\n', 'brand new Container. The only requirement is that containers can only\\n', 'have versions of Linux. Why do container versions have to be some\\n', 'version of Linux? Even though containers feel like they have their\\n', \"own operating system, they truly don't have that. It's an illusion.\\n\", 'They actually share the underlying virtual\\n', \"machine's kernel. So given that all of us\\n\", 'are using Linux GCP VM, the cost that is associated\\n', 'with a Linux kernel. We can only run\\n', 'Linux containers on top of the Linux GCP VM. So containers only support\\n', 'Linux operating system. So a couple of other\\n', 'things about containers. First of all, containers are a lightweight alternative\\n', 'to virtual machines. Imagine having to provision a new virtual machine for every single project\\n', \"in this course, that's going to be a pain\\n\", 'point because it takes some amount of time for you\\n', 'to create a VM from scratch. As opposed to that,\\n', 'all of you will be creating and running a new Docker container\\n', 'for every project, and also for every topic\\n', 'that we cover in the course. That will give you access to a new development\\n', 'environment that can be tailored towards one particular application\\n', 'programs need. Different application\\n', 'programs will have different needs in terms of maybe one of them will need Python specific version, another one will require a\\n', 'different version of Python, and different version\\n', 'of Java, and so on. As I mentioned, the\\n', 'physical OS underlying, which can be\\n', 'physical or virtual, depending on whether\\n', 'you have a VM under it that is being shared\\n', 'between all the containers, which makes it very efficient. And programs in\\n', 'different containers can use different\\n', \"flavors of Linux. We'll go through\\n\", 'examples of that. The only catch is\\n', 'that you cannot have Windows OS running\\n', 'on a container. Any questions on the\\n', 'basics of container? Yeah. >> So is it specific\\n', 'application container for Linux or any OS cannot\\n', \"have a different OS container. >> That's a really\\n\", 'good question. I have never heard about\\n', \"a Windows container. I'll get back to you\\n\", \"after the lecture. We'll look it up\\n\", 'after the lecture. So here is the thing that all of you\\n', \"should know about me. I'm not a huge fan of Windows platform if that\\n\", \"was not already evident. I'm not that much\\n\", 'experienced with it because, to put it mildly,\\n', \"I hate Windows, so I don't usually teach\\n\", \"myself things about Windows. So we'll figure\\n\", 'that out together after the lecture.\\n', \"Good question. Any other questions? Sorry to all the Windows folks in this room. It's just me. Probably you guys love Windows. Let's talk about sandboxing. So sandboxing is often referred to as another term\\n\", 'for similar to containers. Both virtual machines\\n', 'and containers are examples of sandboxes. Sandboxes provide\\n', 'you this environment within a physical or\\n', 'a virtual machine, where you can play\\n', 'around with things. And if something goes\\n', 'wrong with the sandbox, you can always throw\\n', 'away the sandbox without having to worry about the underlying physical\\n', 'or the virtual machine. So I have a computer here, which can either\\n', 'be considered as a physical or a virtual machine, within which I have\\n', \"some running processes natively on that computer, either whether that's on\\n\", 'a VM or on a physical OS. As opposed to that, I have four different\\n', 'sandboxes over here. Within a sandbox, you can have your own version of individual software\\n', 'applications. For instance, this one\\n', 'is running Python 3.9, this one is running Python 3.10. I want all of you to take a quick minute to go through\\n', 'this code on the left here, and one of you pop your hand and volunteer to\\n', 'answer this question. What exactly is this code trying to do? Yes. >> Recursively trying\\n', 'to delete everything. >> Recursively trying\\n', 'to delete everything. rm, you need to be\\n', 'very careful with it. I told you about rm\\n', \"command the last lecture. Once you remove anything, it's going to be final. Not only is rm usage is bad, this is actually forcibly\\n\", \"removing everything. It's not even going to\\n\", 'prompt you whether you want to actually\\n', \"delete everything. And it's going to recursively, the r flag indicates that\\n\", 'delete everything in the subsequent directories that show up in the hierarchy\\n', 'of directories. Remember, slash is\\n', \"the topmost directory on any Unix file system. Pretty much, I'm just like wiping the entire system clean. We'll go through an\\n\", 'example for that today, but I will give\\n', \"all of your heads up to check that you're not on your virtual machine to\\n\", \"make sure that you're not deleting your existing\\n\", \"files and directories. So let's dive. Why did I talk\\n\", 'about this example? Well, when you are\\n', 'within a sandbox, if you do something really\\n', 'bad like this, no problem. You can just throw out\\n', 'the sandbox and create a new sandbox and start\\n', 'from scratch again. Your underlying physical or your virtual machine is not\\n', \"going to get affected at all. Now, let's learn about\\n\", 'Docker registries, images, containers,\\n', \"and Dockerfiles. Today's lecture, let me\\n\", 'take a quick minute to show you that we have a\\n', \"worksheet for today's Lecture 2. I'm looking for this one. So you have a list\\n\", 'of Docker commands. Again, feel free to\\n', 'use this worksheet to take notes as you see fit. You can take notes after\\n', \"today's lecture as well. So what did I do? Let me go back to where I was. Majority of the Docker commands\\n\", 'are going to be Docker, and then some sub command and\\n', 'then some set of arguments associated with that\\n', \"particular command. Let's learn about\\n\", 'what registries are. Registries are collections\\n', 'of Docker images. Docker images work similar to how operating\\n', 'system images work. You need an image to be able to install a particular\\n', 'operating system. Similarly, you need a\\n', 'Docker image to be able to create a Docker container or launch a docker container\\n', 'from that particular image. The most commonly used\\n', 'registry is hub.docker.com, which contains a lot of pre-created images for\\n', \"all of you to use. A couple of examples of images. There is a MySQL image, there is an Ubuntu image. Sometimes we'll\\n\", 'start from Ubuntu, sometimes we might start\\n', 'from specific images. There is an image for\\n', 'MongoDB and so on. So other than this publicly\\n', 'available registry containing so many\\n', \"different images, various corporate companies have their own private registry. If you're within the\\n\", \"corporate network, you'll be able to\\n\", 'access the registry and even put your own custom\\n', 'docker images in there. This is definitely going\\n', 'to be private access only. From this public registry\\n', \"or your private registry, you'll be able to do a pull of a particular image on\\n\", \"your virtual machine. Let's talk about VM because we're all going to be using VMs. So the Docker pull command enables you to pull\\n\", 'a particular image. And then once you\\n', \"pull the image, you'll be able to launch or run containers by using the\\n\", 'Docker run command. So that will provision various containers on\\n', 'your virtual machines. So you have two different\\n', 'things associated with Docker on your\\n', 'virtual machine. You have your images, and then you have your\\n', 'containers which are being launched or\\n', \"run from the images. And we'll cover all of these Docker commands in\\n\", 'detail as part of the demo. So once you create a container from one\\n', \"of these base images, let's say that you want to\\n\", 'create a custom container. I was mentioning about\\n', 'language that you need to use. Very simplistic language. You need to create a\\n', 'file called Dockerfile, which is going to have four\\n', 'different command options. And you can say, from\\n', 'what is the base image, run a particular installation, for example, this\\n', 'one is installing Pandas on top of the\\n', 'base Ubuntu image. And then once you do\\n', \"the installation, that's going to create a snapshot from\\n\", 'which you can create your own image build by using\\n', \"the Docker build command. Again, we'll go through\\n\", \"an example for that. Once you create a new image, using the Docker build command, you'll be able to use the\\n\", 'Docker run command again to provision or to launch\\n', 'a new container. So Docker supports a\\n', \"lot of reproducibility. So that's another advantage. It provides you sandboxing, and also it enables reproducibility because\\n\", \"we'll be able to very easily take somebody else's\\n\", 'Docker configuration and reproduce that on\\n', 'some other machine easily from scratch with\\n', 'all the installation, including all the dependencies. So basically, everybody\\n', 'can be aligned with respect to various\\n', 'software version numbers. So one thing that I want to keep emphasizing from the\\n', 'first Docker lecture, you need to be very active about cleaning up\\n', \"your Docker containers. If you don't clean\\n\", 'up your containers, your virtual machine\\n', \"is going to slow down. I'm not going to go over\\n\", \"individual commands over here. We'll learn about each of these commands as\\n\", \"part of the demo. But I've summarized these\\n\", 'commands on the slide deck, so you can find these\\n', \"in a single place so that you'll keep doing cleanup throughout the course of\\n\", 'this particular semester. For example, just to give you a sense of what do\\n', \"I mean by clean up, let's say that after\\n\", \"today's lecture, we're going to move\\n\", \"on to SQL topic. We're probably going to create a Docker container with\\n\", \"MySQL installation. We're done with SQL, we'll move on to MongoDB. Before you move on to MongoDB, please make sure to\\n\", 'do Docker cleanup for all the containers that you\\n', 'created for the SQL topic. Similar to that,\\n', \"you'll be doing that for cleanup between P1 and P2, P2 and P3, and so on. Let's do Top Hat before\\n\", 'we go through demo. As always, please feel free to discuss the Top Hat question\\n', 'with your neighbor. Also, starting with\\n', \"today's lecture, Top Hat questions will\\n\", 'have 0.1 point for correctness and 0.9\\n', \"points for participation. I'm just going to extend it for 15 more seconds just to make sure everybody has had a chance to actually answer. So please make sure to\\n\", \"submit your correct answer. That's when it actually\\n\", 'gets recorded on my end. Most of you got the\\n', 'answer correctly. So if you want to find all the details\\n', 'about the processes, ps should be the correct\\n', 'answer here and not lsof. Lsof is going to enable you\\n', 'to figure out details about network connections and not\\n', 'just all of the processes. Lsof enables you to get\\n', 'a list of files and directories within either the\\n', 'current working directory or whatever directory\\n', 'you pass as an argument. You have various flags for ls, and then pwd stands for\\n', 'print working directory, indicates the current\\n', \"working directory. Any questions about any of the shell commands that we've\\n\", 'covered so far. Question. >> Could you please repeat\\n', 'the difference between ps and lsof and Htop because\\n', \"doesn't Htop also show details. >> Sure. So ps\\n\", 'actually lists all of the currently running\\n', 'processes associated with various levels of access. You can either list the\\n', 'processes associated with the current shell session\\n', 'or the entire OS. You have various flags for that. Remember, we have ps, psax, and so on. So ps literally is about listing all the details of the currently active\\n', 'running processes. Htop specifically tells\\n', 'you the memory and the CPU utilization\\n', 'associated with each process. Lsof, on the other hand, lists the currently active\\n', 'network connections on your virtual machine or on your physical\\n', 'machine for that matter. Any other questions? Awesome. We are going to\\n', 'dive into Docker demo now. Let me go ahead and\\n', 'clear my screen. The very first thing\\n', 'that I need all of you to try is to\\n', 'simply type Docker. First of all, quick\\n', 'question before that, how many of you have installed Docker on your virtual machine? Roughly, like half of you\\n', 'are raising your hand. If your hand is not up, please install Docker at\\n', \"least by today so that you'll be able to try out these\\n\", \"commands after the lecture. So just entering Docker, we'll list a bunch\\n\", 'of commands for you. You can use this output to\\n', \"learn about various commands. We'll focus on specific\\n\", 'subset of these commands, the ones that are listed on\\n', \"today's lecture worksheet. Let me go ahead and\\n\", 'clear my screen. The first command that\\n', \"we're going to do is to use the Docker pull\\n\", 'command to pull images. So where are we pulling\\n', 'the images from? Once again, let me show\\n', 'you the source over here, which is going to be\\n', \"this hub.docker.com. So if you go to hub.docker.com, you'll see a list\\n\", 'of possible images. This one has memcached\\n', 'installation, nginx installation. Alpine is a lightweight\\n', \"Linux Docker image. And then you have Ubuntu. Let me click on Ubuntu. So if I click on Tags, you'll notice that\\n\", 'there are a bunch of Ubuntu versions\\n', 'that you can see. One of the tags will be\\n', 'referred to as latest. If you do a pull\\n', 'without specifying what tag version\\n', \"you want to pull, it's always going\\n\", \"to pull whatever is associated with the latest tag. And if you go down more, you'll be able to find\\n\", \"specific versions of Linux for you to pull from here. So I'm not going to go over\\n\", \"the entire website here, rather let's actually do a\\n\", \"demo of the pull command. So I'm going to try\\n\", \"the version 24.04. That's the version\\n\", \"that you've been asked to use for Project P1 for majority of the ubuntu\\n\", 'based docker containers that we are going to be using\\n', 'throughout this semester, the docker container\\n', 'ubuntu version will be 24.4 versus virtual machines\\n', 'version will be 22.4. So there is some other thing\\n', \"associated with tags called this LTS that's often referred to as the\\n\", 'latest stable version. So often developers\\n', 'would want to keep the stater version for their base operating system\\n', 'and then experiment with, like, more recent versions\\n', 'inside the docker containers. So basically, docker container\\n', 'is like one big place for you to do a lot of experimentations with and\\n', \"if things don't work out, you can always\\n\", 'throw the container and start from scratch. So docker pull that pulled\\n', 'ubuntu 24.04 image. How can I confirm that? The command to list all\\n', 'the docker images is going to be docker space images. As you can see, from\\n', 'the ubuntu repository, I have the tag 24.04\\n', 'pulled over here. So that brings me to talking about the Docker tag command. You can rename any\\n', 'particular image tag by using the docker tag command. So if I want to say ubuntu 24.04 should be referred\\n', 'to as the latest ubuntu, I can either say first argument here being whatever is the\\n', 'current version of the image, the current tag version, the name of the image, and then followed by\\n', 'colon and then the tag, followed by which I can\\n', 'say the name of the image, and then a new tag over here. You can either explicitly\\n', 'type latest here or you can simply just delete\\n', 'the entire part after Ubuntu and press \"Enter\", and that\\'s going\\n', 'to automatically tag this version as latest. Let me go back and show you docker images command\\n', 'output again. As you can see, both 24.04 and latest have\\n', 'the exact same image ID, but then one is\\n', 'tagged as latest. So if you say docker run, and then ubuntu, always the latest one will\\n', 'get picked up. So you can use tags as well. For instance, I\\n', 'can, for example, create a new tag for the\\n', 'ubuntu image called P1, where I explicitly type ubuntu, and then followed by:P1. For some specific reason, I want to create\\n', 'a tag called P1. Any questions on\\n', 'docker tag command? Let me go ahead and\\n', 'clear my screen. Let me remind all of you about\\n', 'the ETC OS release file, which enables you to check the current version of\\n', 'the Linux installed. Hopefully, all of you have made enough progress P1 want to\\n', \"know what I'm talking about. I'm going to do a\\n\", 'cat/ETC/OS-release file. As one might guess, the base virtual machines\\n', 'ubuntu version is 22.04. As opposed to that,\\n', \"we're going to be running a docker container, which is now going to contain\\n\", 'ubuntu version 24.04. Which brings me to talk about\\n', 'the docker run command. Let me go ahead and\\n', 'clear my screen. Let me type a comment before I actually type the\\n', 'docker run command. What does the docker\\n', \"run command do? It's going to enable us to\\n\", \"create a new program in a new container that's going to be the use\\n\", 'case for docker run. This should be on your notes\\n', \"because we're going to soon learn about a\\n\", 'different docker command, which will enable us to start a new program in an\\n', 'existing container. So new program in\\n', 'a new container. The command for\\n', 'that is docker run. And you need to specify\\n', \"the name of the image. I don't have to specify the tag number now because\\n\", \"I've already tagged ubuntu as the 24.04 as\\n\", 'the latest version. So if I skip the tag now, that is the version that will be accessed in order to\\n', 'launch the container. So docker run image name, and then I need to specify\\n', 'a particular program. Docker run command is\\n', \"about running a program. For example, let's say\\n\", 'a simple shell command, which is the echo command. Echo is going to just display\\n', 'whatever you provide us input onto standard\\n', 'output over here. As you can see,\\n', \"the container ran, and it dumped out hello for me. Let's learn few more things about docker run\\n\", 'command over here. There is an option called\\n', 'hyphen-hyphen name, which will enable you to\\n', 'specify specific name for the container that\\n', \"you're trying to launch; specify name for container. So there is a reason\\n\", \"I'm mentioning this. That's because containers\\n\", \"have auto generated names. We'll shortly see what do I\\n\", 'mean by auto generated names. But before that, I need to first tell you how to run a container, which will allow us\\n', 'to interactively run some commands\\n', 'inside the container. So we just ran a simplistic\\n', \"echo command here. Instead of doing that, let's say that I\\n\", \"want to launch bash. That's also ubuntu, I should be able to launch bash. How do I run bash? I need to specify docker run. Bash is an interactive program. In order for me\\n\", 'to be able to run interactive programs\\n', 'that launch a terminal, I need to use the hyphen\\n', 'hyphen flag for interactive, and then the hyphen\\n', 'T flag for terminal. So I need to say docker run -ID, and then the name of the image, which is Ubuntu and then\\n', 'the name of the program, which is going to\\n', 'be Bash over here. Notice that my\\n', 'prompt now changed. This is my virtual\\n', \"machine prompt. I'm now inside my\\n\", \"docker container. I can assure you that I'm\\n\", 'inside my docker container. By doing a cat of\\n', 'ETC OS release, as you can see, we\\n', 'now have 24.04 LTS. Notice that even 24.04 is\\n', \"tagged as a stable version, but it's not been used for long enough as opposed to 22.04, that's why we're still keeping the GCPBM version as 22.04, and we're using docker\\n\", 'versions 24.04. You can run other commands. For instance, you can\\n', 'do echo dollar home. What is my home directory? Notice that inside\\n', \"my docker container, I am the root. That's because it's a\\n\", 'development environment. You should be able\\n', 'to literally do anything without\\n', 'having to type pseudo for every single complex thing that you want to do\\n', 'within your container. Unlike the virtual machine\\n', 'where you have to use pseudo inside a\\n', 'docker container, your by default root. Let me show you the\\n', \"current working directory that's going to be slash. And let's do something\\n\", \"interesting. We're going to reproduce what\\n\", \"was shown on the slides. Be very, very careful that you're not inside\\n\", \"your virtual machine. If you're following along, I am going to run the recursive remove for\\n\", \"deleting everything inside my slash directory and let's see what happens\\n\", \"after we do this. Let's try running\\n\", 'the LS command. What do you think\\n', 'is going to happen? It will not work. Not only did I delete\\n', 'everything inside slash, which is the top of my docker\\n', 'containers file system, I also ended up deleting\\n', 'all of the shell commands. So my docker container no\\n', \"longer knows what LS is. So be very careful to check that you're inside\\n\", 'docker container always. You do any kind of\\n', 'experimentation with it, and then, like, you\\n', 'can be done with it. You can either type\\n', 'exit to exit out of the session or you can press\\n', 'control D to exit out of it. Let me do analysis. All of my funds and\\n', \"directories are there. That's my virtual machine. I didn't end up deleting anything inside my\\n\", 'virtual machine. Any questions on the\\n', 'docker run command or the IT option\\n', 'specifically to be able to run interactive bash\\n', \"shell, sorry. Question? >> [inaudible] >> We'll go through an example for the exact command\\n\", 'shortly and then, hold on to your\\n', \"question until then. Any other questions? Okay. Let's see. I am going to clear my screen, and I'm going to\\n\", 'show you one thing. So I showed you that the docker pull command enables you\\n', 'to pull a specific image, and then the docker run\\n', 'command enables you to use that image to\\n', 'launch a container. Turns out that the docker\\n', 'run command can also pull an image if the\\n', 'image does not exist. For example, let me try and run an interactive\\n', 'mode, docker run-ID. I am going to try and launch a container from\\n', 'Alpine version 3.16, and let me run shell within it. Bash is not supported\\n', \"with an alpine because it's a light\\n\", 'weightinux container. So let me go ahead\\n', 'and press \"Enter\", as you can see, from the output, unable to find that particular\\n', 'image locally, but then, it is pulling it from the docker hub repository not to be able to provision or launch that\\n', \"particular container. Of course, I'm inside\\n\", 'my container now. If I try to run bash, that should not work\\n', 'because Alpine is such a lightweight container. Let me type exit this time to show you that\\n', 'will also work just like control D. So here is the downside of this command\\n', \"working really well, though. If you try to run a container which doesn't\\n\", 'actually exist for example, if I say docker run -ID typo, there is nothing called typo within the docker\\n', 'hub repository. So if I go ahead and do this, notice that your error is actually directing you\\n', \"to some log in issue. Unfortunately, it's\\n\", 'not a log in issue. There is no such\\n', 'image called typo, so just be aware\\n', 'of the fact that this error response from the\\n', \"Docker demon is very weird, and that you'll have\\n\", 'to pay attention, make 100% sure that your docker image name is\\n', \"correct whenever you have, custom images that you're using. Any questions about\\n\", 'the docker run command before we move on to\\n', 'the docker PS command? Okay, let me clear my screen. Recall that PS\\n', 'enables you to list all the currently\\n', 'active processes. Remember, PS actually is an exception with\\n', 'respect to shell commands because you specify options or flags\\n', 'without a hyphen. For instance, I can say PS AUX instead of\\n', \"saying PS hyphen AUX. That's the syntax to say that. Unlike that, docker PS is\\n\", \"sort of like going back to the regular shell command way of specifying options of flags. First of all, let's\\n\", \"take a look at the output of docker PS. Nothing is showing up here. What about if I use the A flag? And docker PS, you're\\n\", 'going to have to type in the hyphen and not type Q, type A. Docker PS-A. That lists a bunch of things. Remember, I was\\n', 'telling you about the hyphen hyphen name option to use with docker run command. Because when you use\\n', 'docker run by default, the name of the container\\n', 'gets auto generated. The Auto generation actually uses a hyphenated\\n', \"naming terminology. It'll use an adjective\\n\", 'before the underscore, and then name of\\n', 'some famous person after the underscore\\n', 'unless you really want to remember the name of your container image\\n', 'that is auto generated. I would recommend you to use hyphen hyphen name to\\n', \"actually name your container, especially if you're\\n\", 'going to be using Exel command a lot to run other things within\\n', 'your container. So what are all of\\n', 'these containers? So I thought we exited from\\n', 'all of the containers, then you exit from a running docker\\n', \"container that doesn't essentially clear up the\\n\", \"docker resource utilization, so you're going to have\\n\", 'to worry about cleanup, which is what I\\n', 'was talking about, at the end of the slide deck, you have a bunch\\n', 'of commands listed as part of the very last slide. So the very first thing\\n', 'that I want to go over is the docker RM command, which enables you to\\n', 'remove a stain image. That is a container that has\\n', 'already stopped running. A docker RM enables you to\\n', 'remove a stale container. So how do we use the\\n', 'docker RM command? You can either\\n', 'specify the name of the container or\\n', 'the container ID. So where can you find\\n', 'this information? So there is a column\\n', \"called container ID. That's the first\\n\", 'column output from docker PS command,\\n', 'PSI-A command. And then you also have\\n', 'the name of the image, which is the last column. You can either use the\\n', 'container ID to remove the stale docker container or you can use the\\n', 'container name. For example, let\\n', 'me actually go to the beginning of this\\n', \"command and comment it out, and let's try both ways. I'm going to say docker RM, and then I'm going\\n\", 'to say container ID, which just now deleted my\\n', 'stale alpine container. And if I want, I can use the name as well. Looks like a nice name. Laughing_ tausig. I have no idea who Tausig is, but looks like a nice name. So if I go back to saying\\n', 'docker PS hyphenate, that will only list the\\n', 'other stale containers now. Is there a way to delete all\\n', 'of the stale containers? Definitely, there\\n', 'is a way for you to delete all the\\n', \"stale containers. You're going to have to use two different\\n\", 'commands together. First of all, let me show you one other option for\\n', 'docker PS command. There is the hyphen Q option, which is a quiet option, which only lists\\n', 'the container IDs. Pretty much either container\\n', 'ID or the name is what you need to be able to remove that particular\\n', 'stale container. So how do you combine this\\n', \"with the docker RM command, which removes stale containers? You'll have to specify docker PS command\\n\", \"within double vertex, open vertex, close vertex. So I'm going to have\\n\", 'to type docker PS-AQ, that will give me a list of all the container IDs for\\n', \"the stale containers, and I'm going to run docker\\n\", 'remove on all of them. So if I go back to\\n', 'saying docker PS-AQ now, you should not see\\n', 'anything because I deleted all of the\\n', 'stale containers. Any questions about docker\\n', 'remove or how to use it? Okay. It is very important\\n', \"that you clean up your unused docker containers because that's going to\\n\", 'use up resources for you. So docker RM is\\n', 'going to enable you to remove docker containers. How do you remove docker images? You have docker RMI, which is a different command. Let me go ahead and\\n', 'clear my screen. Docker images lists all the\\n', 'images that you have pulled. Docker RMI stands\\n', \"for remove image, hence RMI we'll take in\\n\", 'the name of the image. For instance, let\\n', 'me say Alpine:3.16. I need to specify\\n', \"the tag because it's explicitly a tag\\n\", 'name and not latest. So if I go back to\\n', 'listing docker images, you will no longer\\n', 'see Alpine 3.16. Not only do you have to\\n', 'remove stale containers. I would also encourage\\n', 'all of you to keep removing unused images as well because all of that\\n', 'is going to take up your resources and\\n', 'slow down your VM. So the next thing that\\n', 'I want to go over, with respect to a\\n', 'little bit more cleaner is a command\\n', 'called docker system. You can just type docker system, and that will list individual commands\\n', 'within that for you. Two specific commands that\\n', 'I want to talk about, docker system DF will list free disk space for the docker associated with\\n', 'docker images and containers, just like how we have disc free space by\\n', 'using DF shell command. You have docker system DF. Then another useful command\\n', 'is docker system prune, which is going to prune up all the memory and all the disk space\\n', 'associated with unused or stopped containers. You can go ahead\\n', 'and press, \"Yes\". I did not get any reclaim\\n', \"space that's because I already used docker RM to remove all the\\n\", 'stale containers. This is going to enable you\\n', \"to remove additional cash and stale container memory usage and disk usage, and so on. Let's go ahead and wrap\\n\", \"up today's lecture here. We'll continue the\\n\", 'docker commands at the beginning of\\n', 'the next lecture. I will see all of you on Friday.']\n",

Hopefully, all of you remember what the definition\\n', 'of a process is. Any instance of a\\n', 'running program is typically referred\\n', \"to as a process.

            "['the previous lecture. I did get one question\\n', 'during my office hours, which I wanted to address while\\n', \"we cover today's lecture.

So I showed you how\\n', 'you can use the helpers.bulk function to process every individual\\n', 'restaurant dictionary and index each of those\\n', 'using this single index, which is New York City\\n', 'nyc_restaurant index. One thing that I would\\n', \"like to mention though, I'm not sure if in P4, this is a requirement or not. I've asked audience to clarify this as part of the ReadMe. Instead of indexing\\n\", 'individual restaurants dictionary as\\n', 'individual documents, you could index the\\n', 'entire json file itself as a single\\n', 'document as well. Lease ARN solution\\n', 'for P4 was indexing the entire json documents in entire txt files as\\n', 'a single document, instead of indexing\\n', \"individual documents within that collection of json, whatever the json represents.

If you just dump the\\n', 'mapping as such, it will display the mapping\\n', 'as an ObjectApiResponse. If you want to format\\n', 'it a little bit more, you can always use the\\n', 'json module and create a proper indented version of this dictionary after converting it into a\\n', 'dictionary though.

Any questions on how to use\\n', 'get_mapping to explore the, if you think about\\n', \"it in a schema, even though you don't\\n\", 'enforce the schema here. Unlike client bulk\\n', 'method which will just literally dump all of the documents that\\n', 'have been indexed, the helpers bulk function\\n', 'does not do that. How can you take a look at all the documents that\\n', 'have been indexed after you go through helpers.bulk\\n', 'function invocation? Recall that early\\n', 'during last lecture, I mentioned how\\n', 'you can search for all matching documents by\\n', \"specifying particular query. Let's expand on that query. I'm just going to define\\n\", 'a variable called query, which is going to be\\n', 'of dictionary type. So as opposed to just mentioning the query content as match underscore all being\\n', 'an empty dictionary, which is what we did\\n', \"during last lecture, I'm going to introduce\\n\", 'a new field value pair, which is going to help\\n', 'us control the number of items that are getting\\n', 'returned by that such query. So first of all, let me\\n', 'define the query itself. The query part is going to be\\n', 'exactly the same as before, excepting that\\n', \"previously, we did not use the key as query. So match all that's\\n\", 'going to be the key. The value is going to\\n', 'be an empty dictionary. Previously, we just\\n', 'pass this dictionary as an argument to\\n', \"the query parameter. Now, we're going to invoke search search method using body parameter\\n\", 'arguments so hence, you need to explicitly\\n', 'mention what the query is. And in order to control the\\n', 'number of documents that get written by your\\n', 'search method, you need to explicitly define the field size and also\\n', 'what the value for sizes. We have 2,546 documents. My size here is\\n', 'going to literally to mention 2,546 documents. Let me uncomment\\n', 'these iterative lines of code over here just\\n', 'to do a quick review.

Specifically, I'm\\n\", 'just extracting the DBA fields value corresponding to all the\\n', 'inspected restaurants over here. So by default, search method only returns\\n', \"the top 10 search results. That's something that I missed mentioning during last lecture.

Thanks to the student, I'm\\n\", 'making sure to highlight this. Any questions at all about\\n', 'displaying the content of the index documents after having utilized the\\n', \"helpers bulk function?

But I just wanted\\n', 'to let you know that the ordering\\n', 'of the documents inside the hits list is going to be dependent\\n', 'on the relevance, which comes from\\n', 'the scoring factor. So as you can see, actually, give me\\n', \"just one second, I'm just going to make\\n\", 'some modifications here so that we have the previous version\\n', \"of this response. So you're only seeing\\n\", \"10 inspections from the Manhattan neighborhood. Even though you're\\n\", 'seeing a total of 931 matches to the\\n', 'original search query. Hopefully, all of you\\n', 'remember from last lecture that inside the hits dictionary, you have another\\n', 'dictionary that has total L key and another second\\n', 'level nested dictionary, which has value as the key, that gives you the total number of returned search results. So you had 931 results but your search is only going to give you\\n', 'the top 10 results. So how can you control\\n', 'the size here?

Any questions at all about\\n', 'size or source specification? >> I just left the\\n', 'questions from the previous lecture in case any if you had any questions. Since nobody has asked\\n', \"me any questions, I'm going to assume that you actually don't have\\n\", 'any questions. If you do, you can always\\n', \"post on Piazza just in case. If you haven't already watched\\n\", \"the lecture, that's okay. So let's move on to\\n\", 'the new questions. Find all inspected\\n', 'restaurants that have Italian or Mexican in their\\n', '\"CUISINE DESCRIPTION\". I\\'m going to cover one more\\n', 'example for multi_match here. Give me a second. I just want to make sure I\\n', 'have the documents in order. For the query part, I need to get started by defining what the\\n', \"query itself is, so that's going to be my\\n\", 'outermost dictionary. And then your match type\\n', 'is going to be the key within the inner dictionary\\n', \"which represents the query. Let's do multi_match. So multi_match that's the\\n\", 'operator for multiple match. Multi_match not only enables you to do multiple matches across\\n', 'different fields contents, it also enables you to perform multiple value\\n', \"matches corresponding to a single field as well. So that's the use\\n\", 'case scenario for this particular question\\n', \"corresponding to multi_match. I'm going to define an\\n\", 'innermost dictionary within the dictionary. I need to specify the query\\n', \"again, why the query? Because I'm doing multi_match. I'm going to specify the potential value that we're going to search as part\\n\", 'of query by saying query, and then I can put in all of the search terms that are\\n', \"separated by the or here. For instance, here, it's going\\n\", \"to be Italian and Mexican. You don't quite mention the or there in between\\n\", \"those two terms. That's going to\\n\", 'get configured as value corresponding to a\\n', 'field called operator. But before we get to that, we need to specify what\\n', 'the field itself is based on which we want to\\n', 'perform this multi_match, and F-I-E-L-D-S. Hopefully,\\n', 'all of you remember that the value corresponding\\n', 'to fields needs to be a list of fields\\n', 'that you want to work with. In this case, I\\n', \"only want to search inside the CUISINE DESCRIPTION, so that's going to be the value corresponding to the fields, just a list containing\\n\", 'CUISINE DESCRIPTION. And for specifying the operator, I need to explicitly type the\\n', 'key operator and the value here is going to be the operator \"OR\"\\n', \"that I want to apply. So let's go ahead and take a look at the number of results. As you can see, 191 results are getting returned by\\n\", 'the search query. But the top 10 are just Italian restaurants\\n', \"that have been inspected. So let's just make sure to retrieve all of\\n\", \"those 191 results. So I'm going to specify size, and let's just pick\\n\", 'a number above 191. You could also\\n', 'exactly type in 191, just in case if you need that. As you can see, if\\n', 'you scroll down, pass all the Italian\\n', 'restaurants, you should be able to see the Mexican restaurants\\n', 'information. So this query enables\\n', 'you to perform multi_match between\\n', 'this search phrase and this search phrase, applying the \"OR\" operator\\n', 'on this particular field, which is CUISINE\\n', 'DESCRIPTION. Question. >> I remember in Question 5, which is the question above, we also used the multi\\n', \"search for [inaudible]. And in that case, we didn't\\n\", 'use the operator \"OR\", so what does this\\n', 'operator [inaudible]? >> The default operator\\n', 'is \"OR\" I think. Let me confirm that. Hopefully, I\\'m not\\n', 'wrong about that. So you probably need not explicitly mention\\n', \"the OR operator. Let's put a pin on that\\n\", \"and I'll make sure to answer that question\\n\", 'early next lecture. Really good question. So where was I? So this is one way of answering this question,\\n', \"using multi_match. Actually, we'll keep coming to this question over\\n\", \"and over again during today's lecture\\n\", 'because there are so many ways to\\n', 'answer this question. So because it annoys me, I am going to go ahead and keep commenting\\n', 'out the result and re-running the cell so as to not create this huge dump of output. Feel free to do that when you\\n', 'work on Project P4 as well. Just make sure\\n', \"that you're saving the response using the save\\n\", 'response function correctly. Now, alternate option. Instead of using multi_match, you could just use a\\n', 'simple_query_string as well. For a simple_query_string, you\\'re going to mention the \"OR\" using the\\n', 'vertical pipe symbol. And usually, when you need to\\n', 'go through multiple fields, typically, multi_match is going to be the option\\n', 'that you go with. Because this particular\\n', 'question only has a single field associated\\n', 'for the search operation, it would be possible for you to use simple_query_string\\n', 'instead of using multi_match. So let me copy\\n', \"paste the code from the previous solution, and I'm going to\\n\", 'change the operator from multi_match to\\n', 'simple_query_string. And the query format is now going to be\\n', 'slightly different. You\\'re going to have to mention \"OR\" using the pipe symbol. And obviously, you don\\'t need\\n', 'to explicitly mention what the operator is because\\n', 'you have already mentioned that within\\n', 'your query field. Once you go ahead and\\n', 'run this, hopefully, you should get the exact\\n', 'same results as before, but using a different\\n', 'operator simple_query_string. I believe there is one\\n', 'Project P4 question which explicitly asks you to\\n', 'use simple_query_string. So I just want to\\n', 'make sure that I introduced a\\n', 'simple_query_string operator. Any questions about\\n', 'either of these options of answering this question\\n', 'before we move on to boosting? So what exactly is boosting? Boosting is the process\\n', \"by which you can modify the relevance of the keywords that you're\\n\", 'going to apply to your search within a\\n', 'particular document. So I mentioned that\\n', 'the ordering of the hits depends\\n', 'on the relevance, and the relevance depends on how exactly those entries are scored by your scoring\\n', 'algorithm, which is BM25. So can you override the score calculation\\n', 'in order to make some results more relevant\\n', 'than other results? The answer is yes or no. It depends on the scenario. Elasticsearch is\\n', 'extremely challenging for you to work with when\\n', \"you initially get started.

So I still want to go ahead\\n', \"and show you that solution, even though that wouldn't\\n\", 'work for my current dataset. So there are two different types of boosting that\\n', 'you can perform. You can perform boosting\\n', 'when you perform indexing, that is when you actually\\n', 'go ahead and create the index associated with all\\n', \"of the related documents. You can then and there mention which fields or which values within those fields are going to be of significance, but that's not what\\n\", \"we're going to do. Why? It could always\\n\", \"be possible that the boosting that you want to perform change over the time. What would have been relevant yesterday probably wouldn't\\n\", 'be relevant today. So which means that it is\\n', 'not actually recommended to perform boosting while you\\n', 'index as opposed to that, it is highly recommended\\n', 'to perform boosting while you actually go through\\n', 'the querying process. So I have the reading\\n', 'link for you here. Again, optional reading. Feel free to go through\\n', \"that if you're interested in learning more information. This is actually a big whole\\n\", 'book about Elasticsearch. You could just go through this to find other relevant\\n', 'sections of the book as well. So find all the inspected\\n', 'restaurants that have Italian or Mexican in\\n', 'their \"CUISINE DESCRIPTION\", exact same question as before, but provide a higher scoring for Mexican instead of\\n', \"Italian restaurant. And I've given you exactly what the boost factor should be\\n\", \"for Mexican, which is 10.0. So let's first learn how to\\n\", 'update the previous query using simple_query_string\\n', 'to mention the boosting values here. So Instead of mentioning the \"OR\" as the\\n', \"operator in here, even in simple_query_string, you could mention the operator as a separate field value pair. So I'm just going to go back to the multi_match way of\\n\", \"describing the operator. That's the syntax that you would need in order to\\n\", 'specify boosting. First of all, how do\\n', 'you specify boosting? Each search term is going to be associated with a boost value. And the syntax for mentioning boost value is going to be\\n', \"by using the caret symbol. So I'm going to mention\\n\", \"Italian and then caret. And well, I don't want\\n\", \"to boost Italian, so I'm just going\\n\", \"to get rid of that. Let's boost Mexican\\n\", 'by saying Mexican, and I want to apply a\\n', 'boot score of 10.0 for Mexican keyword\\n', 'matching results. So can you just do this\\n', \"as search in here? Unfortunately, you're\\n\", 'going to have to enclose the individual\\n', \"keyword that you're trying to boost inside a string. So I'm going to have to\\n\", \"use quotations here. And clearly, I'm\\n\", 'going to have to use the escape character because the entire thing\\n', \"is a string here. So for Italian, you're\\n\", 'not doing any boosting. For Mexican, you are\\n', \"boosting the score by 10.0. And let's see if that makes\\n\", \"any difference at all. Give me just one second. What am I missing here? Sorry, the field name should be default operator and not operator because it's\\n\", \"simple_query_string. Again, I don't expect\\n\", \"all of you to remember all of these minor quirks. I'm hoping you'll\\n\", 'write it down in your note sheet and not having to memorize all of those for\\n', 'the purpose of final exam. Did the boosting work? Not quite. We still have Italian results as the top few results and Mexican results as the\\n', 'bottom few results. Is it because I had Italian as the first keyword\\n', \"within my search query? Let's go ahead and switch that, and let's see if that makes\\n\", \"any difference at all. It shouldn't. So clearly, the boosting here\\n\", 'is not working. So let me mention a\\n', 'few reasons as to why Italian is still getting\\n', \"ranked higher than Mexican. So let's go through four\\n\", 'specific reasons here. First reason has to do\\n', 'with term frequency. Hopefully, most of you would\\n', 'have heard of the term TF, IDF, which has to do with the term frequency\\n', 'scoring calculation. So It could be possible\\n', 'that the term Italian appears more frequently across the documents in our\\n', 'original dataset, that would mean\\n', \"that Elasticsearch default ranking algorithm, again, that's BM25, will still give\\n\", 'higher weightage for Italian despite you explicitly\\n', \"configuring the boost. That's unfortunate. So we're going to have\\n\", 'to get around that. If I have to place my\\n', '$0.02 guess on this, term frequency is probably\\n', \"the reason as to why we're not getting Mexican\\n\", 'results boosted here. Few other reasons, the\\n', 'length of the document. If the documents that\\n', 'mention Mexicans are longer, Elasticsearch will\\n', 'probably think that those documents\\n', 'are less significant. It tends to place more emphasis on shorter documents\\n', 'than longer documents. So if the documents containing\\n', \"Italian are shorter, that's going to be a problem. And you could also think about specific field type\\n\", 'coming into play here. For instance, the tokenization that Elasticsearch performs for the text field violation\\n', 'description could affect how exactly the\\n', 'score calculation is done, that is things like how exactly\\n', 'stemming or normalization is done might affect exactly how the\\n', 'scoring is calculated. And again, you have other finer nuances\\n', 'with respect to how exactly the document\\n', 'frequency is calculated, associated with the\\n', \"term frequency, TF, IDF, that's what\\n\", 'the term stands for. And that could literally make Italian rank higher\\n', 'than Mexican. So how exactly can\\n', 'we rewrite our query to make sure that\\n', \"Mexican gets boosted? Unfortunately, you're going\\n\", 'to have to split your query into two different\\n', 'disjunct queries. And you can achieve that\\n', \"using something called as disjunction max query. It's going to enable you\\n\", 'to return the document matching one or more\\n', 'wrapped queries. And the dis_max query specifically\\n', 'assigns the document, the highest relevant score based on whatever boots\\n', \"that you mentioned. So we're now going to\\n\", 'split the query into two different queries\\n', 'using dis_max. Let me go ahead and\\n', \"start typing the query. That's going to be the very\\n\", 'first dictionary query in the corresponding dictionary. Within that, the operator\\n', 'now is going to be dis_max, and the value corresponding to that operator is going to\\n', \"be an inner dictionary. Within that, so far, we've only have had to\\n\", 'handle a single query. This is the first time\\n', \"we're going to be mentioning more than one query. So the field name is now\\n\", 'going to become queries, and the value is going to\\n', 'be a list object instance. And within that list, you need to specify dictionaries corresponding\\n', 'to each query. And I have two different queries here for those two\\n', \"different terms. That's going to be what I'm\\n\", \"going to be mentioning here. I'm going to be using\\n\", \"match operator. That's going to be my\\n\", 'innermost operator. What do I need to match against? Whenever you mention match, you need to specify\\n', \"the name of the field. Give me one second. I'm going to comment\\n\", 'this out and copy paste the field name so as\\n', 'to not make a typo. So the field name here is going to be \"CUISINE DESCRIPTION.\" And after mentioning\\n', 'the field name, you have to mention the\\n', 'actual query itself, which is going to be\\n', 'another inner dictionary. So the query is going to\\n', \"mention your search term. Let's start with Mexican. That's going to be the\\n\", 'term that you look for. And then you need to mention what boosting that you\\n', 'want to perform here. So the boost is going to\\n', 'take 10.0 as the value. Just give me one second. I want to make sure that I\\n', \"have the right syntax there. I'm going to confirm\\n\", 'that by going through my completed\\n', \"version of the notebook. Floating point value, 10.0. Let me copy paste this and make modifications for Italian. For Italian, we don't want\\n\", 'to have any boost factor, so I can completely remove\\n', 'the boost value pair and leave the query as\\n', \"such as Italian. And let me actually extract only the relevant fields here. So I'm going to mention, for my _source, my list here is going to be\\n\", 'having the values as DBA, and let\\'s also pick \"CUISINE DESCRIPTION\"\\n', 'because those are the things that we want to be\\n', 'able to answer this query. What am I missing? I am not going to bother\\n', \"fixing this syntax. I'm going to copy\\n\", \"paste this query from my completed version of the dictionary, please excuse me. I don't want to\\n\", 'spend time on that. So as you can see, once you make sure to split those queries into\\n', 'two different queries, the boosting actually overrides whatever other factors that are applicable whenever\\n', 'the scoring is calculated by Elasticsearch\\n', 'when you do full text search. Any questions at\\n', 'all about boosting? >> So to reiterate, when you perform the\\n', 'boosting for Project P4, the other factors are not\\n', \"going to come into effect, so you don't quite have to\\n\", 'use disjunction max query. So you could just use simple\\n', 'query string to be able to answer the question\\n', \"maybe Q4 or Q5, one of those questions. Let's move on to the next part, which is going to\\n\", 'enable us to highlight the results within the\\n', 'search operations. And in order to motivate\\n', \"the highlighting process, I'm going to go back\\n\", 'to talking about the actual use case\\n', 'scenarios where elastic search is deployed. Recall that I mentioned that elastic search is\\n', 'a great platform. Whenever you want to\\n', 'perform any searches, remember that the\\n', 'Uber apps search actually is being run\\n', 'on elastic search. And also, things like, you have a lot of other\\n', 'famous platforms. If you want to develop a grocery search application or even a dating application, it would be a good idea to use elastic search as\\n', \"your search engine. So whenever you're using your search engine to\\n\", \"search for something, wouldn't it be nicer if you\\n\", 'have a way of being able to highlight parts of the search result\\n', 'using HTML formatting. That could make sense.\\n', 'When you do Google search, it will actually highlight\\n', 'the occurrence of the matching term within the search result by\\n', 'bolding that term for you, or you can mention other\\n', 'highlights as well if you want to build your\\n', \"own search engine. So that's why the highlighting\\n\", 'process is significant, might look less significant\\n', \"to you as a developer who's just using the\\n\", \"highlight process. But as the customer who's going to be using your\\n\", \"search application, it becomes really relevant. That said, let's actually learn how to go through the\\n\", 'highlight process. Find all inspected\\n', 'restaurants that have Mexican and Cuisine\\n', 'description and highlight the Cuisine description\\n', 'field in the results. So let me go ahead and start\\n', 'typing the query here. The query here is going\\n', \"to be simple query. Let's do actual\\n\", 'match phrase here. So that I can talk about the difference between\\n', 'match and match phrase in case that did not come out\\n', 'really well from last lecture. Match is going to have\\n', 'a flexible search. As opposed to that,\\n', 'match_phrase will look for exact match of the phrase that you mentioned\\n', \"within your search term. What's the difference between using match_phrase and match? When you mentioned, let's say, a search term which has two\\n\", 'different words in match. The two words can occur in any\\n', \"order inside the document. They can be placed anywhere. They don't have to be together. As opposed to that, when you have match_phrase, the search term that\\n\", \"you're looking for should occur exactly as\\n\", 'you have mentioned. Of course, you can have, like, exception\\n', 'for case matches. But then other than that, the entire term should\\n', \"be present there. So that's the difference\\n\", 'between match and match_phrase. For the purpose\\n', \"of this question, you don't quite\\n\", 'need match_phrase, but I had match_phrase\\n', 'in my notes so that I can highlight this difference and talk about the difference. So once again, the\\n', 'field that is of significance is going to\\n', 'be cuisine description. Match_phrase has a\\n', \"different syntax. Hopefully I'll remember\\n\", 'from the previous lecture. You need to mention\\n', 'the field description, a field name as the key\\n', 'within your NMOs dictionary, and the match_phrase that\\n', 'you want to search as the value corresponding\\n', 'to that particular key. And let me make sure to mention the relevant\\n', 'source fields here. I am going to only extract DBA and the cuisine description. I am going to copy\\n', 'base that for sure. Both DBA and the\\n', \"cuisine description. So that's what we know so far. How do you actually\\n\", \"highlight the matches? You're going to\\n\", 'specify highlight as the key within your\\n', 'outer query dictionary. And then within the dictionary corresponding to the highlight, you can specify how exactly you want to\\n', 'perform the highlight. For instance, you can just specify what field\\n', 'that needs to be highlighted by saying\\n', 'fields is the key, and the corresponding\\n', 'value is going to be a dictionary where you\\n', 'specify the field name. As the key, and the value here is going to be an\\n', \"empty dictionary. So let's take a look at\\n\", 'what exactly this does. As you can see, it inserts the EM open and close HTML tag, surrounding the highlighted\\n', 'part of the text, which is going to be\\n', 'about the Mexican part in the cuisine description. So you still get the\\n', 'original cuisine description within the source field, and you still have the\\n', 'original dictionary. Other than that, your hits is also going to have\\n', 'a highlight field, which is going to have a dictionary as value\\n', \"corresponding to that. And within that dictionary, you're going to have key\\n\", 'as the name of the field, and the value is going to be the actual highlighted version of that particular fields value, which that particular\\n', 'match_returns. And for the\\n', \"highlighting operation, you don't have to use just what is showing\\n\", 'up as the default. You can also mention other\\n', 'tags like strong tag. And let me go through\\n', 'one more example where you can explicitly mention bolt tag by using\\n', \"pre tag and post tag format. And I'm going to copy\\n\", 'paste the query from the previous version so\\n', 'as to keep updating it. Instead of just saying, highlight the field\\n', 'cuisine description, corresponding to the\\n', 'innermost dictionary, you can define things\\n', 'like what needs to be the pre-tag and what needs\\n', 'to be the post-tag. So the operators for those\\n', 'prep-tags and post-tags. And you can have more than\\n', 'one pre and the post-tag. As we all know, HTML always\\n', 'allows like nested tag usage. So you can always have more\\n', \"than one formal But I'm just going to show you\\n\", 'one entry within here. As one would guess, the post-tag should\\n', \"correspond to the pre-tags and don't mess it up by\\n\", 'using weird HTML notation. When you open the tag, please\\n', 'go ahead and close it. And if I go ahead and run this, now instead of the EM tag, as you can see, we\\n', 'have the strong tag, and you can use the post and the pre-tag to use any kind of HTML formatting to highlight\\n', 'your search results. Any questions at all about\\n', \"highlighting operations? Let's move on to\\n\", 'Boolean operators. I briefly mentioned the\\n', 'three Boolean operators on the slide when we spoke about the difference between MongoDB text search and\\n', \"elastic search text search. I wish they're just\\n\", \"called and or not. Unfortunately, they're not. Must corresponds to,\\n\", 'shod corresponds to r, not correspond to not. The most thing that I hate\\n', \"about this is that they used should for OR. That's a little bit confusing. Usually when you say shaould, you expect something to\\n\", \"contain that for sure. Unfortunately, we're\\n\", 'all going to have to remember that shod\\n', \"corresponds to OR. So let's go through\\n\", 'some rapid fire of, simplistic examples to learn\\n', 'about these three operators. The first question, find\\n', 'all Italian restaurants that were inspected\\n', 'in Manhattan. I can do this as soon as I\\n', \"get control of my notebook. I have no idea what happened. I'm not going to waste the time. Let's just go through\\n\", 'the questions from the completed version\\n', \"of the notebook file. Just give me 1 minute. I'm just going to try and\\n\", 'see if I can run this. For some reason, my notebook\\n', 'sometimes freezes over. Find all Italian restaurants that were inspected\\n', 'in Manhattan. So clearly, you want\\n', 'an and operator, Italian restaurants, Manhattan, two different conditions here. So the outer operator for any Boolean operator application\\n', \"is going to be bool, and you're going to specify\\n\", 'that within the query. As a value\\n', \"corresponding to bool, you're going to have\\n\", 'an inner dictionary. And value the field within the inner dictionary\\n', 'is going to be your Boolean operator\\n', \"in this case, and so it needs to be a mast. And the value clearly needs to be a list because you won't apply and over those matches. And the matches here are going to be the first one is going to match for cuisine\\n\", 'description as Italian. The next one is\\n', 'going to match for the BORO being\\n', 'Manhattan over here. And you can always keeps, I have to run the cell\\n', 'containing nyc_index definition. Just give me 1 minute. So you can always run\\n', 'the query to find out how many matches are there, and then accordingly define the size field, as you can see, these are all the\\n', \"restaurants that have Italian cuisine description in Manhattan that were inspected. That's the operation. Let's go through OR operation, find all inspected\\n\", 'restaurants that have Italian or Mexican in\\n', \"the cuisine description. Again, we're back\\n\", 'to this question. Third way of answering\\n', 'this question is by using the Boolean\\n', 'operator should corresponds to R. So the innermost list here is going to have a match both for\\n', 'Cuisine description field, one for Italian and\\n', \"one for Mexican. And because you're\\n\", 'mentioning should here, the OR operator is going to get, uh applied in between those two match\\n', 'operator applications. Hopefully, this should give us the search results that\\n', \"we're looking for. As we all know, from\\n\", 'the boosting examples, the Italian restaurants\\n', 'will show up first before the\\n', 'Mexican restaurants, just like one more way of\\n', 'solving that question. The third Boolean operator is going to be the must not\\n', 'operator corresponds to not. Find all inspected restaurants\\n', 'that are not in Bronx. So must not operator luckily, has the exact same\\n', 'syntax requirement as the should and\\n', 'the must operators. They could have made the innermost list\\n', 'as like not a list, but lucky for us, they did not. So the innermost list here, even though you only\\n', \"have one condition, it's going to be\\n\", \"enclosed within a list, and you're going to\\n\", 'mention whatever the condition that you\\n', 'want to apply a node on. And we want to find\\n', \"all inspections that were not in bronx, and Must_not is going to be the operator that's\\n\", 'going to enable us to do that. So we have 2,285 results\\n', 'from this search. You can always confirm that this query is definitely giving\\n', 'you the correct answer by matching for the number\\n', 'of hits that you get when you search for prongs. As we all know, there are 2,546, documents\\n', 'in the original index. For my own confirmation sake, I just wanted to make sure that Must not is\\n', \"actually working. There isn't something\\n\", 'called should not. Any questions at all\\n', 'about Boolean operators? Question. Yeah, you can combine multiple Boolean\\n', 'operators in a single query. You can always mention, like one query\\n', 'followed by which, like, you have,\\n', \"like another query. I'll show you an example of that at the beginning of\\n\", \"the next lecture in case, if you're curious, I don't\\n\", \"have one in today's lecture. Okay. Let's move to\\n\", \"aggregation operations. And let's see if I haven't\\n\", 'been able to get back. My notebook is not\\n', 'frozen anymore. How many restaurants are\\n', 'listed in the dataset. The very first\\n', \"aggregation operation that I'm going to go through is, how can you perform count\\n\", 'operation using aggregation? So in order to answer\\n', 'this question, clearly we need to match\\n', 'all of the documents. So my query here is going to have Match all instead of any other specific\\n', \"kind of match. So I'm going to say Match\\n\", 'A is is my operator, and the value needs to be an empty dictionary\\n', 'for Match All. And let me Hr. The next thing that\\n', \"I'm going to mention here is going to\\n\", \"be the size field. For aggregates, you need to mention the size field as zero, because the actual matches don't really matter to you because you're only looking for result\\n\", 'of aggregation operation. And how do you actually\\n', \"specify aggregation operation? Just give me 30 more seconds. We'll finish just this question and wrap up to race lecture. Aggregation operation\\n\", 'needs to be mentioned within the operator ags. And then the value\\n', 'corresponding to that, uh, key is going to\\n', \"be a dictionary. Within the dictionary, you're going to be defining\\n\", 'a new field, whatever aggregated value\\n', \"that you're calculating, for instance, total restaurants. That's what we're\\n\", 'computing here. This is the name of the new\\n', \"field that you're creating. And then the value\\n\", 'corresponding to that is going to be\\n', 'the actual operation, and count is going to be\\n', 'the operator value_count. And the corresponding value\\n', 'needs to be the field, which you want to do\\n', \"the count based on. And in this case, you can try to do the DBA field, which will not work. I'll just wrap up the lecture here by saying that you need to explicitly use the\\n\", \"keyword field within that, and I'll talk about why that is the requirement at the\\n\", 'beginning of the next lecture. I will see all of you on Friday. Actually, one quick note. Quiz, for this week\\n', \"is due tomorrow. Please don't forget\\n\", 'to take the quiz.']\n",

            "['the sake of the exam. So question 1. Find the name of\\n', 'the amenities of listings where the number\\n', 'of amenities is exactly 5. The series and I\\n', \"hovered over amenities. We're going to solve a bunch of array operator\\n\", 'questions specifically on the amenities fields. Once again, quick review. My DB variable contains my database object\\n', 'instance reference, which we create by specifying\\n', 'the name of the database, along with the client\\n', 'object instance, which enables us to establish the client connection to\\n', 'the MongoDB database.

Let's leverage the fine\\n\", 'method, once again, which is going to be one of the most common\\n', \"methods that you'll be using for Project P3. So recall that fine method\\n\", 'takes two arguments. The first one is going to\\n', 'be your query dictionary. The second one is going\\n', \"to be your projection. Just to make my life easier, I've left the\\n\", \"projection argument as a pre-typed argument. Let me fill in the query, and then I'll do\\n\", 'a quick reminder of the syntax of the\\n', 'projection argument. So the query takes a dictionary, and within the dictionary, you need to specify whatever condition\\n', 'you want to impose. The field name here is\\n', 'going to be amenities. And then for the value, I need to be able to\\n', 'apply an operator. Whenever you need to\\n', 'apply an operator, the value needs to be\\n', 'a nested dictionary. The key within the nested dictionary needs to\\n', 'be the operator. Here you need the\\n', 'size array operator, which enables you to compute\\n', 'the size of an array. And what condition\\n', 'do I want to impose? I want to be able to impose\\n', \"an equality condition, so I don't need another\\n\", 'nested dictionary here. I want the size to be exactly 5, so I can just go ahead\\n', 'and mention the value corresponding to the\\n', 'operator size here to be 5. And quick review of the\\n', 'projection argument here, you need to pass the dictionary, and you need to specify field value pairs\\n', 'separated by commas. For any field that you want the cursor to include that\\n', 'particular field detail, you are going to\\n', 'mention the value is 1.

By default, if you don't\\n\", \"mention a regular field, it'll not get displayed, but the _id field\\n\", 'is an exception, so you need to\\n', 'explicitly mention that is 0 if you want to\\n', 'filter that out. So I am applying list listing here to\\n', 'display the top 3 results. As you can see, this list over here gives\\n', \"you the Airbnb listings, which have exactly 5 amenities. Let's move to the next question. Hopefully, there won't be any questions on\\n\", 'the size operator. The next question is\\n', 'asking you to find the name and the amenities of all listings that have\\n', '\"Pack \\'n Play/travel crib\". I\\'ll fix the question phrasing\\n', 'later on, my apologies. As you can see, I am developing these questions just based\\n', \"on my mom requirement. You're going to see a bunch\\n\", \"of baby related questions. My apologies if that's\\n\", \"very weird to you. So let's find all the\\n\", \"Airbnb listings that have Pack 'n Play and travel crib as part of their amenities list. So in order to do that, my query here is going to once again apply a condition\\n\", 'on the amenities field, and once I specify\\n', \"the amenities field, I need to specify my condition. So I'm looking for specific\\n\", 'items in my array, as you might guess based on\\n', 'my emphasis on the term in, the operator that you need here is going to be the in operator.

Hopefully, all of\\n', 'you remember that, whenever you use in operator\\n', \"or not in operator, you're going to have\\n\", 'to specify a list of items for the match\\n', 'or for the non match. So this time, my list is simply going to\\n', \"contain one item, which is Pack 'n\\n\", \"Play or travel crib.

As you can see, Pack 'n\\n\", 'Play/travel crib is one of the amenities listed within\\n', \"this particular listing. That's how you match for items within your\\n\", \"embedded array. Let's move on to\\n\", 'the next question, which is asking\\n', 'you to solve this. Find, again, the name of the listing and the amenities\\n', 'associated with it, where the amenities list\\n', \"contains two things, Pack 'n Play or travel\\n\", 'crib and high chair. So which means that you\\n', 'need to ensure that both of those should be present\\n', 'within your embedded array. And the operator that you need for that is going to\\n', 'be the all operator, which enables you to match that the embedded array contains all of the elements that\\n', \"you're looking for. Suppose, it's a deal\\n\", 'breaker for me, if a particular listing does not contain both\\n', \"of these things, I'm not going to consider that. So let me go ahead and type\\n\", 'the query one more time. Actually, in fact,\\n', \"let's copy paste the query from the\\n\", \"previous questions so that I don't have to\\n\", 'keep formatting it again. Given that we are dealing\\n', 'with the same field, instead of the in operator, we now need to use\\n', 'the all operator. And of course, I need to mention my other amenity as well, which is going to be\\n', 'the high chair amenity. So hopefully, if you\\n', 'scroll down here, you should be able to see\\n', \"high chair somewhere, Pack 'n Play is right there, and where is the high\\n\", 'chair, right about there. So this should give you\\n', 'all of the listings, which contain all of the\\n', 'items that you mentioned within your matching\\n', \"list over here. Let's move on to\\n\", 'the next question, which is going to slightly change the previous\\n', 'questions requirement by saying that I now only need at least one\\n', 'of these amenities, instead of, needing both\\n', \"of these amenities. Let's say that having at least one would\\n\", 'make my life easier, so just to increase the\\n', 'number of chances of me being able to find a\\n', \"good baby friendly listing, I'm going to give it a\\n\", 'shot by searching for at least one out of\\n', \"those two options. Give me one minute. I'm\\n\", \"going to copy paste the query previous question, and I'll tell you what\\n\", 'operator you need here. So you are going to be using the element match operator scrolling up to show\\n', 'you the description. Element match enables\\n', 'you to select documents if at least\\n', 'one of the element in the array field matches all of the specified\\n', 'element match conditions. So in this case, we only have\\n', 'one condition, which is, look for an item within the\\n', 'list of items over here. Give me a second to\\n', 'scroll back to Q4. So instead of using\\n', \"the all operator, I'm now going to have to use\\n\", 'the element match operator. Element match\\n', 'operator is going to expect a dictionary\\n', 'as the value. So let me define the\\n', 'dictionary right after that. Inside the dictionary,\\n', \"you're going to have to use the in operator.

Any questions about the\\n', 'array query operators, which are all element\\n', 'match and size? Question. >> [inaudible] should\\n', 'I directly use in and list of two objects? >> List of two objects. So your question is\\n', \"going back to here, can't I just do this\\n\", 'one instead of that? Yes, actually you could, but I wanted to demonstrate\\n', 'element match as well. There will be use case scenarios where you would\\n', \"need element match, and you cannot the in operator. I don't have an example\\n\", \"for that to this lecture, but I'm sure, we can come up with a question that you would need element match.\\n\", 'Good question. Any other questions? So at the end of the previous lecture, I mentioned that the\\n', 'expr operator can also be used with embedded arrays in order to apply\\n', \"various conditions. So today's lecture,\\n\", \"we're going to learn why the expr operator requires you to use dollar sign to indicate\\n\", \"the field names. But before that, let's go\\n\", 'ahead and solve this question, which is asking you to find all the listings with\\n', \"at least 10 amenities. Clearly, you're going to have to type the expr operator here. So the operator here\\n\", 'is going to be $expr. And hopefully, all of you remember from\\n', 'previous lecture that the value associated with expr operator needs\\n', 'to be a dictionary. And then in there,\\n', \"you're going to specify condition or\\n\", 'a list of conditions depending on whether\\n', 'you want to apply and operator or other\\n', 'logical operators. So the condition\\n', 'here is going to be greater than or equal to 10. So my conditional operator\\n', 'is going to be gte, and whenever you have\\n', 'greater than or equal to, your value needs\\n', \"to be a list type. The very first item within the list needs to be some field. We'll come back to that. The second item is\\n\", \"going to be simple. It's just going to\\n\", 'be the scale at 10 because you want to be\\n', 'able to apply greater than or equal to\\n', 'operator between the field and between\\n', 'the scale at here. Now, the question is, can\\n', 'you just say amenities here? Probably not, because you\\n', 'need the list size here, so which means that you need\\n', 'to use the size operator. So I need one more\\n', 'inner dictionary, where my key here is going\\n', 'to be the size operator, and the value once again, remember that when\\n', \"you're using expr, you need to specify the\\n\", \"field name using $amenities, so that's going to be\\n\", 'the name of the field, and that should retrieve\\n', 'all of the listings that contain at\\n', 'least 10 amenities. As you can see based on\\n', 'the first top 2 results, definitely you have more than 10 amenities in these listings. Any questions about\\n', 'expr operator or any of the array operators? >> After the next\\n', 'couple of questions, which are going to introduce slicing inside the\\n', \"projection argument, let's do top hat. So I just wanted to give\\n\", 'all of you a heads-up. So slicing is one of the\\n', \"MongoDB projection operators. In today's lecture,\\n\", \"I'll only cover slice. I haven't decided\\n\", \"if I'm going to be covering the rest of the\\n\", \"projection operators or not, I'll decide that before\\n\", \"Monday's lecture. So far, we've only been\\n\", \"dealing with query operators. So I've written you an\\n\", 'important note here. Slicing is applied inside the projection and\\n', 'not inside the query, otherwise known\\n', 'as the selection, because slicing is a\\n', 'projection operator. The very first such example. Slice is going to enable\\n', 'you to limit the number of items that gets displayed as\\n', 'part of your embedded array. For example, if we\\n', 'only wanted to get the first three amenities for each listing for\\n', 'some weird reason, how are you going\\n', 'to go about that? Your query here is going\\n', 'to be an empty dictionary, unless and until you pass this as a named\\n', \"keyword argument, which I'm not passing it here as a named keyword argument. Since it's positional,\\n\", 'I need to mention an empty dictionary for\\n', \"the first argument. So for the projection argument, I'm going to end up selecting name amenities and excluding ID. Before I select the amenities, I want to be able to\\n\", 'apply my slice operator. Whenever you need to\\n', \"apply an operator, you need to have a dictionary. So the key within the dictionary here is going to be slice. And for the value, you want the first three items, so it's going to be\\n\", 'positive number 3 here, that slices the first three\\n', 'elements or first n elements. So that will give you the first listing of\\n', 'first three amenities. If you want the last\\n', \"three amenities, you're just simply\\n\", 'going to mention -3, which will give you the\\n', \"last three amenities. This will come in handy for, like, some other field. For amenities, it doesn't make any sense for you to\\n\", 'slice and display the top three because you probably want to look\\n', \"at all the amenities, but I didn't want to switch the dataset just to\\n\", \"introduce slice. So I'm just showing you\\n\", 'slice use case with a dummy example instead of an actual real-world\\n', \"scenario one. Any questions at all about slice before we do the top hat? Let's do top hat. I literally give you\\n\", 'answer to this question. So hopefully all of you should be able to\\n', 'answer it correctly. Again, as always, please\\n', 'feel free to discuss the top hat question\\n', 'meant to be interactive. Hopefully, most of you got\\n', 'the correct answer here, which is the expr operator. So why is the expr\\n', 'operator an exception? So when they developed\\n', 'the expr operator, they wanted to mainly associate the expr operator with\\n', 'aggregation-related operations. So expr is actually not the\\n', \"only exceptional operator, you'll need to use dollars to explicitly indicate\\n\", \"that you're talking about a field name and not a\\n\", \"regular string value in place of the field's name. So we'll cover pipeline stages later during today's lecture. And some of the stages in pipeline where you\\n\", 'perform aggregation will expect you to use the dollar sign for\\n', 'indicating a field name. Not all of the pipeline\\n', 'stages require that, though. Any questions at all\\n', 'about the expr operator? While you all were\\n', 'answering top-hat question, I realized that I\\n', 'missed mentioning one logistic item which\\n', 'I wanted to go over. We have received a couple of requests from at least\\n', 'two or three groups, for project P3 groups of\\n', \"students who are working on the project together if they can make individual submissions. Please don't do that. Please feel free to solve the project individually\\n\", \"on your own. But for the sake of submission, let's make the TS lives easier. So please make a single\\n\", \"submission so as to not have them do double work when you're actually partnering\\n\", 'up with another student. Let me reemphasize what I said. I always encourage\\n', 'students to solve the entire project on their\\n', 'own, but collaboratively. So it is going to be a\\n', 'good idea for you both to type the solution out entirely\\n', 'from scratch on your own. But for the purpose\\n', 'of submission, please just have one of you push a version into the\\n', 'Git repository that said, like, we do expect that\\n', 'both partners will have made at least one Git\\n', 'push into the repository. Any questions at all\\n', \"about P3 logistics? Let's go back to our\\n\", \"lecture flow over here. Now, we're going to\\n\", 'switch temporarily from the Airbnb dataset to a different dataset\\n', 'called analytics dataset. So quick overview of\\n', 'the dataset here. Your sample analytics dataset\\n', 'contains three collections, account information,\\n', 'customer information, and transactions associated\\n', 'with various accounts. There is a specific\\n', \"reason why I'm switching to a\\n\", \"different database. That's because the\\n\", 'next section is going to tell you how to\\n', 'combine information from multiple\\n', \"collections otherwise known as previously JOINs. You don't use the\\n\", 'term JOIN that often when you solve simplistic JOIN-based\\n', \"questions using MongoDB. I'll tell you why we do that shortly after\\n\", 'we solve the question, it should be pretty\\n', \"obvious why we don't use the term JOIN. So first of all, let's go ahead and create a brand new database. Sample analytics. I've already loaded the\\n\", \"sample analytics database onto my MongoDB server, so I'm not going to be\\n\", 'running these two cells. You probably would\\n', 'want to do it because your docker container\\n', 'is not going to contain the three JSON files that we just saw inside the\\n', \"documentation description. Now, first of all, let's do some exploration here before we dive\\n\", 'into the question. So your database is going to contain three\\n', 'different collections. So the first one is going to\\n', \"be the account's collection, so let me invoke\\n\", \"find_one method on it. So that's the info\\n\", 'that you have. You have your account ID and\\n', 'the limit associated with account and what products does that particular\\n', \"account support? And then you have the customer's collection,\\n\", 'which contains, information about the customer, including username, name, address, birth date,\\n', 'which is going to be of significance for\\n', 'the next question. And then you have a list of all the accounts associated\\n', 'with the customer, and then, like other details associated with the customer. And then within the\\n', 'third collection, which is going to\\n', 'be transactions, I am going to once again, invoke the find_one method. As you can see, the transaction\\n', 'collection document is really large. As one would expect, you have a list of\\n', 'all the transactions associated with\\n', \"individual account IDs. So that's the relationship between three different\\n\", 'collections over here. And then if you scroll down, you have an array of\\n', 'all the transactions. This is embedded information but associated embedded\\n', 'information because the collection is\\n', 'about transactions. So as opposed to that, the relationship between\\n', 'the three collections here is going to be a\\n', 'linked relationship. You can take your\\n', 'account document and link that with a customer by matching the account ID which is showing up within the\\n', \"account's array over here. And then once again, from the account ID information, you can associate the\\n\", 'transactions with individual customers and\\n', 'individual accounts as well. Let me go ahead and\\n', \"comment this out. So later during the lecture, we'll figure out how to perform an outer JOIN between the accounts collection and\\n\", \"the customer collection. For now, we don't need anything complicated as the OUTER JOIN. So how are we going to\\n\", 'solve this question? As I mentioned, the birth date information\\n', \"is going to come from the customer's collection, and the transaction\\n\", 'information is going to come from the\\n', \"transaction's collection. We really need to perform a JOIN to be able to\\n\", 'answer this question, not always, is going\\n', 'to be the answer. So find all the\\n', 'transactions made by customers born in 1988. Once again, definitely\\n', \"my favorite year. You'll see a lot of\\n\", 'recurrence of 1988 here. So the very first step here is going to be able to find all of the account IDs\\n', 'associated with all of the customers that were\\n', \"born in the year 1988. I'm defining my start date and end date time object\\n\", \"instances here. As one would guess, I'm using January 1st, 1988, as the start\\n\", 'date and January 1st, 1989 as the exclusive end date, not an inclusive one. So in order to make sure that we answer\\n', 'this initial question, which is find all\\n', 'the account details associated with\\n', \"customers born in 1988, I would probably need to query the customer's collection\\n\", \"because that's where the birth date\\n\", \"information is coming from. So db.customers.find. And let me define my query here. My query's field name is\\n\", 'going to be birth date. And my value needs\\n', 'to be a condition. And the conditional operator needs to be greater\\n', \"than or equal to. And I'm going to say\\n\", \"greater than or equal to the start date, start_date. That's not all that I need. I need to make sure that the\\n\", 'customer was born in 1988. So I cannot use\\n', \"less than or equal to because the end is exclusive, so I'm going to use a less\\n\", 'than operator and mention the end date as the value corresponding to\\n', 'the less than operator. So other than the query itself, let me also modify the projection\\n', 'parameters argument here so as to retrieve\\n', \"only some details. So I'm going to retrieve all\\n\", 'the account information and also the birth\\n', \"date field's value while ignoring the\\n\", \"ID field's value. What am I missing? I need to scroll down here. Unknown operator LT, because\\n\", 'I am missing a dollar sign. Since this error popped up, I want to just use this\\n', 'moment to mention one thing. What would happen if your field\\n', \"has a typo, for instance, if you say Y here instead of an E. Let's take a look\\n\", 'at the result here. Annoyingly, MongoDB is not\\n', \"going to throw any error. Why? Remember that we're working with schema\\n\", 'semi-structured data. How in the world\\n', 'will MongoDB Server know that this is not the\\n', \"field that you're looking for? So my tip for all of you for\\n\", 'solving Project 3 questions, if the result is empty, look closely at the field names, I would strongly actually\\n', 'recommend you to copy-paste field names\\n', 'so as to avoid typos and unnecessarily wasting\\n', 'your precious time on silly things like this. So going back to the\\n', 'previous version, by changing the birth\\n', \"date over here, as you can see, we're able to find account information for all of the customers\\n\", 'born in the year 1988. So this is one step\\n', 'of the process. Now, how do you use all of the account information that\\n', 'you retrieved over here in order to take that info and execute a find query on the\\n', \"transactions collection? That's going to be\\n\", 'a simple process. You have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is going to contain a\\n', 'key called accounts, and the value is going to\\n', 'be a list of account IDs. You just need to collapse\\n', \"that into a single list, and then you'll be able\\n\", 'to use the in-operator on the transactions collection in order to be able to answer\\n', \"the original question. So I'm just going to initialize an empty list called\\n\", \"all_accounts here. And I'm going to\\n\", \"simply iterate over every customer's information\\n\", 'for customers born in 1988. What do I want to do? I want to be able to retrieve\\n', 'the accounts. So let me use the variable\\n', \"accounts for that. And I'm going to say\\n\", 'customer of accounts. I am using dictionary\\n', \"[inaudible], so that's going\\n\", 'to be the syntax. I need to be able to populate\\n', \"all of the account IDs into this master list over here, so I'm simply going to use extent because we already\\n\", \"have another list here. So I'm just going\\n\", 'to take everything within that list and add that as an item within\\n', 'this all_accounts list. And let me display\\n', \"all_accounts after we're done. So that's the list of\\n\", 'all the account IDs corresponding to all of the\\n', 'customers born in 1988. Now, here is the final step of the process of solving this question without\\n', 'even using JOINs, which is like go to the\\n', 'next relevant collection, which is going to be the\\n', 'transactions collection and utilize all accounts\\n', 'variable here, combine it with the in-operator\\n', \"in order to be able to find the associated information. So let me type this in. So I'm going to say account ID, that's going to be my field. And my condition here needs to be based on application\\n\", \"of in-operator. So far, we've been\\n\", 'hard-coding the list of items corresponding\\n', \"to the in-operator. We don't have to do that in\\n\", 'this question because we literally wrote query\\n', 'to find that list. And this will give you all of\\n', 'the transactions associated with all of the accounts\\n', \"of customers born in 1988, and I'm displaying one such transaction document\\n\", 'entry over here. Any questions at all\\n', 'about solving questions using multiple collections\\n', 'without using JOINs? >> So the last few questions\\n', 'in the simple section of Project P3 will not\\n', 'require you to apply joint, so you just need to keep\\n', 'using multiple find or relevant method invocation to be able to answer\\n', \"those questions. Now, we're going to move on\\n\", 'to aggregation operations. Aggregation\\n', \"operations enable you to do a bunch of things. The first case scenario is going to be about grouping values from multiple documents together within a single collection. And on top of the grouping, you'll also be able to perform operations on the group data to generate a single result\\n\", \"and do some analysis like, apply aggregate functions, we'll cover an example of some and maybe one more\\n\", \"aggregate function. I'm not remembering. We'll get to that when we\\n\", 'go through the questions. So there are two types of aggregation\\n', 'operation categories. The first one is referred to as single purpose\\n', \"aggregation methods. And we've already\\n\", 'covered a couple of single purpose\\n', 'aggregation methods. We have covered, actually, just one, count_documents. We covered that last lecture. It enables you to\\n', 'figure out the count of number of documents\\n', 'that match your query, that you passes the\\n', 'first argument. So count_documents\\n', 'literally goes through the entire document, in order to be able to\\n', 'answer the question, because you have your\\n', 'filtering option using query, instead a faster way for you to just count the\\n', 'number of documents without having to access the content inside\\n', 'your document. The faster solution\\n', 'is going to be to leverage estimated\\n', \"document count method. As I've mentioned before, you need to not use CamelCase and use\\n\", 'underscore or separator, estimated_document_count\\n', \"on listings and reviews. It'll give you the exact same, I should use, give me a second. I'm just going to make sure that my syntax over here is correct before I move on so\\n\", \"as to make sure why we're getting a zero\\n\", 'here [inaudible]. My apologies. I am a little\\n', \"bit lost in my notes here. You do need an empty'\\n\", 'dictionary to represent the entre document\\n', \"information over here. That's not the problem. The problem is my\\n\", 'database does not have a listings and\\n', 'reviews collection. Again, one of those\\n', \"annoying things that MongoDB does to you, you'll not have to worry about this syn Project P3 because you'll be using a\\n\", 'single database. Since we keep switching\\n', 'between databases, now I need to make sure to use sample_airbnb\\n', 'database over here. And that will enable\\n', 'us to come up with the exact same\\n', \"result as what you'd get and count_documents if you don't pass any associated arguments. So my apologies, I don't think you need the empty\\n\", 'dictionary because your only argument is going\\n', \"to be the options argument and we haven't spoken\\n\", 'about options at all. So just this is a faster way of estimating the number of documents within\\n', 'your collection. So the only new method\\n', \"that we're going to talk about here is going to be the\\n\", \"distinct aggregate method, single purpose aggregate method. As one would guess, it's going to return an array of distinct values associated\\n\", 'with the specified field. The syntax here is going to\\n', 'be to pass two arguments. First one is going to\\n', 'be name of the field. The second one is going to be whatever filtering operation\\n', 'that you want to apply. As you can see, you\\n', 'can actually invoke the distinct method without actually running a find query, because even the distinct\\n', 'applies the query before it performs the\\n', \"distinct.retrieval. So let's go through a\\n\", 'few questions here. What are the distinct\\n', 'property types? So, clearly, I need to\\n', 'invoke the distinct method and the field name is\\n', \"going to be property_type. And that's it. I just want distinct\\n\", 'property types, so that will give you a list of all the distinct\\n', 'property types from all of the documents inside\\n', \"the Airbnb collection. Now, let's take this query\\n\", 'and expand it a little bit. What are all the\\n', 'distinct property types in the United States? So I have my field\\n', 'name argument here. Clearly, I need an\\n', 'additional query argument. So the query is going to\\n', 'impose the condition. So I happen to know that the name of the country is\\n', 'within the address field. So hopefully all of\\n', 'you will remember that if you want to\\n', 'access a subfield, you need to use the dot operator as the separator\\n', 'address.country. And then the value\\n', 'here is simply going to be United States and that will give you all the\\n', 'distinct property types inside the United States? As you can see the\\n', 'previous questions list contains more number of items than the current\\n', 'questions list. No clue what the\\n', 'differences are. Last question, demonstrating\\n', 'distinct method, what are all the suburbs in the United States where we\\n', 'have property listings? Once again, suburb is\\n', 'going to be part of the Address field, S-U-B-U-R-B. That gives you all\\n', \"the distinct suburbs. Unfortunately, I don't think\\n\", \"they have a city name. That's why I'm\\n\", 'choosing to answer this question based on\\n', 'the unique suburbs in US, where you have\\n', 'property listings. Any questions at all about single usage\\n', 'aggregation operators before we move onto\\n', 'aggregation pipelines. So aggregation pipelines are\\n', 'going to enable you to solve the medium difficulty\\n', 'level questions and also, maybe some of the actually, all of the, most challenging\\n', 'question section as well. So aggregation pipeline. You got to learn a\\n', \"bunch of stuff here. I'm not going to go over\\n\", \"the documentation, rather. I'm going to leave all of you to read through\\n\", \"this documentation, but I'm going to\\n\", 'talk about how to use individual stages of pipelines to be able to build\\n', 'your aggregation pipeline. So the first three that\\n', 'I want to talk about are the match group and\\n', \"the project stages. And let's directly\\n\", 'get started with the aggregation pipeline stages by solving a question here. So notice that we are now switching back to Airbnb\\n', 'for the questions. We only solved one question\\n', \"using the analytics dataset. We'll come back to\\n\", 'the analytics dataset when we need to go\\n', 'through join operation. For now, to introduce the\\n', \"basics of aggregation pipeline, I'm just going to use a\\n\", \"single collection dataset, which is the Airbnb dataset. So, let's answer this question. Find the average price rounded\\n\", 'to two decimal places of all entire home apartment\\n', \"room type listings to make our lives easier. I've listed the field\\n\", 'name itself over here. So, first of all, what pipeline stages do we need in order to be able\\n', 'to solve this question? So you need the Match stage, which is going to\\n', 'enable you to filter the document based on your\\n', 'specific query predicate. So clearly, we need to\\n', 'apply a filter because we only are interested in\\n', 'entire home apartments here. So your pipeline itself\\n', 'needs to be defined as a list of items and\\n', \"within each item, you're going to specify a dictionary corresponding\\n\", 'to each stage. And the very first\\n', 'stage to solve this question is going\\n', \"to be the Match stage. Within the Match stage, you don't have to specify the field name using\\n\", 'the dollar sign. It is one of the\\n', \"exception pipeline stages where you don't have\\n\", 'to use dollar sign. Please make an note of\\n', 'this in your notes. So for the match, I need to specify\\n', 'my query criteria and the field name is\\n', 'going to be room_type. And the value corresponding\\n', 'to that is going to be entire home\\n', 'apartment over here. And then that completes\\n', 'my very first stage, which is going to\\n', \"be the Match stage. Now, after we've\\n\", 'done the filtering, we need to be able to\\n', 'compute the average price based on all of the entire\\n', 'home apartments listing. So your group stage is what\\n', 'is going to enable you to do this aggregate\\n', \"computation. So within the second entry, I'm going to specify my\\n\", 'stage name as group. Group is not an\\n', 'exception when it comes to specifying field\\n', \"names with dollar. So for group, you're going to\\n\", 'have to use a dollar sign. So associated with group is going to be an\\n', \"inner dictionary. Within the inner dictionary, you're going to specify what field you want as the ID\\n\", 'for your grouping process? Do we need any ID\\n', \"here? Not really. We've filtered all of the\\n\", 'entire home apartment listings. Once you do that, I want\\n', 'to be able to aggregate all of them and compare the\\n', 'average price for that. So the ID Keys value that you need to\\n', 'specify whenever you want to use all of the data, by aggregating over\\n', 'whatever result your match or previous stage\\n', 'of the pipeline generates. You need to just specify\\n', 'none as the value. And after you specify what field you do the\\n', 'aggregation with, clearly, you need to specify what aggregation that\\n', 'you need to compute. This is going to be name of\\n', \"the new field and followed by which you're going to specify whatever computation\\n\", 'that you want to apply. So I need to compute\\n', 'average price here. As one would guess, the average operator is $avg and as the value corresponding\\n', 'to the operator, I need to specify the\\n', 'name of the field with the dollar sign\\n', \"because you're now inside the group stage\\n\", 'of the pipeline. And you can choose any name for your newly computed field. So let me just generate the\\n', 'name as average_price here. So that defines the pipeline, which is list of two stages, match and the group stage here. How do you actually\\n', \"invoke aggregation? You're going to say database, variable name and\\n\", 'then collection name. And the method name\\n', 'itself is aggregate and the argument needs to be the pipeline that\\n', 'you just created. And that will compare\\n', 'the average price. As you can see, it dumps out a huge\\n', 'decimal number here, which is why the\\n', 'question is asking you to do some rounding here. So how do you achieve\\n', \"the rounding? That's where you need the\\n\", 'project stage in your pipeline. So let me actually copy\\n', 'paste the pipeline from the previous cell\\n', \"to the next cell. And we're going to add one\\n\", 'more stage to this pipeline. Project is going\\n', 'to enable you to specifically select\\n', 'certain fields. Also, you can make\\n', 'manipulations to those fields when you\\n', \"make that selection. So that's going to be the\\n\", 'last stage of this pipeline, which is apply the\\n', 'project operator. Project is not an exception, so you need to use the field\\n', 'name using dollar sign. So for the projects\\n', 'value, you need, again, a dictionary and you need to specify what fields\\n', \"you want to retain. I don't want to\\n\", \"retain my ID field, so I'm just going\\n\", 'to say _id is none. Not of significance\\n', 'for this question because we have one\\n', 'collapsed aggregate result. So for the projection, I need to be able to project the field\\n', 'name average price, but not just use the field\\n', 'name field value as such, but apply the rounding operator, as one would guess, the name of the rounding\\n', 'operator is just $round. And what do you need to specify as the value\\n', 'for the round? You need at least two items. What is the original value, number of digits that you\\n', 'want to do the round up with? As I mentioned,\\n', 'the original value needs to be specified\\n', 'using a dollar sign, so I need a specified $average\\n', \"price inside my list, that's going to be\\n\", 'my first argument. And two is going to be my\\n', 'second argument because I need to round up to\\n', 'two decimal digits, and that gives you a\\n', 'slightly better view with ID removed and the price\\n', 'rounded over here. Any questions on this\\n', 'simple pipeline example. Given the time, I need to be able to go through a\\n', 'few more questions. So rather than type\\n', 'the solution for the next few questions\\n', 'from scratch, let me walk you through the completed version of\\n', 'the notebook so that, all of you are well\\n', 'prepared to solve the project questions until\\n', \"at least Question 31. So we've already\\n\", \"solved Question 12. I've given you just\\n\", 'some code over here, give me a second. I need to go back here and\\n', \"run a couple of things so that I'll be able to run these cells while we're\\n\", \"talking about it. So I've given you some code, which will enable you to\\n\", 'explore various fields within the Airbnb collections document so as to enable you to\\n', 'answer this question. This question is asking, find the top two hosts who\\n', \"have the most listings. So I'm going to introduce two more pipeline stages to be able to solve\\n\", 'this question. Sort stage and the limit stage. I think the meaning\\n', 'of those two stages should be quite intuitive, sort enables you to order\\n', 'based on a particular fields ordering and limit enable you to just apply limit as a filter. So the syntax is exactly\\n', \"the same as before, excepting that you're now going to apply the group stage first. Actually, just give\\n\", 'me one minute. Before we answer this question, I just realized I skipped\\n', \"over Question 12. Let's do Question 12 first. We just computed the\\n\", 'average price for a specific room type by saying\\n', 'entire home or apartment. What if you wanted to calculate the average price for every\\n', 'single room type listing? How do you change the code in the previous question\\n', \"to be able to do that? Simple, you're just going\\n\", 'to change your group stage. Previously, we were\\n', 'mentioning ID equal to none. After having gone\\n', 'through the match stage, which filters only the\\n', 'entire home apartment. Now I no longer need a match stage because I\\n', \"want all of the data. I'm going to start my\\n\", \"pipeline with a group stage. Instead of saying _id is none. I'm now going to\\n\", \"have to explicitly mention a specific field name. That's going to be\\n\", 'room type based on which we want to\\n', 'perform the grouping. So the group by is going\\n', \"to be based on room type. And for the project stage, I'm going to make\\n\", 'absolutely sure to include the ID field because\\n', \"that's how you identify the individual groups. How else can you say which\\n\", 'average price corresponds to which unique value of the\\n', \"room type field over here? So that's another example\\n\", 'of how to use group, this time to specifically\\n', 'create groups of the documents based on\\n', 'a specific fields value. Let me just take ten\\n', \"more seconds and then I'll wrap up\\n\", 'the lecture here. So there are a couple of more pipeline stages\\n', 'that you would need in order to be able to\\n', \"solve Project P3's question. Let's consider up until this question Q12 as the cut off for the purpose\\n\", 'of mid-term topics.

So please make sure\\n', 'to just go through iterative development\\n', 'of that by typing individual stages of your\\n', 'pipeline rather than, dumping all of the stages and\\n', \"breaking your head about, what exactly is not working.

First of all, if you\\n', \"didn't know this, 639 counts for the\\n\", \"advanced computing aspect of data science major. So it doesn't really matter that it is listed as a topic score.

Eventually, this is going to be a regular numbered course. It's not going to happen\\n\", \"until fall of 2025, it'll be offered as 639\\n\", 'again next semester as well. So where does it fit into\\n', 'the hierarchy of courses? I know that at least half of you are coming in\\n', \"from 320 background, so you've had plenty\\n\", \"of Python experience. That's going to be\\n\", 'very useful for you, because majority of\\n', 'the programming that we do is going to\\n', \"be using Python. If you're coming in from 200, 300, 400 series of\\n\", 'courses, that is, if your experience is in Java, you can catch up with learning Python\\n', 'using these two books, which are Think Python\\n', 'and Fluent Python. You should be able to find\\n', 'many other resources as well. You can look for CS\\n', '220 course website, which will give you ready\\n', 'access to the materials that the 320 series of folks have had exposure to in\\n', \"their past courses. Let me talk about the learning objectives for today's lecture. We're going to get\\n\", 'started with talking about course logistics\\n', \"and course policies. Then I'll talk about key\\n\", \"aspects of data management, and we'll also discuss what\\n\", 'the overall course plan is. This being a brand new course. We only have a tentative plan. I have a list of topics in mind that I would\\n', 'like to cover, just because we listed\\n', \"all of those topics, that doesn't mean that we will end up covering\\n\", 'all of those. It depends on how the course flows through\\n', \"the rest of the semester. Let's get started by discussing\\n\", 'about course logistics. First of all, I am\\n', 'sincerely hoping that most of you will show\\n', 'up to in-person lectures. Why? Because I would like to have people on the\\n', \"other side of this room. And I don't really want to\\n\", 'lecture to empty chairs. Is very demotivating. So please shop to lectures throughout the\\n', 'course of this semester. We will be having top-hat questions for me to be able to track\\n', 'lecture attendees, 0.9 points allocated for every question will\\n', 'be for attendance, and 0.1 for correctness, so as to enable all of you to be able to score a maximum number of points\\n', 'just by showing up. And I will be doing score drops. Approximately 10 lecture top hat attendance course\\n', \"will be dropped. That's based on the calculation\\n\", \"that I have right now. Closer to 10 will be the number of drops that you'll see at the end of the\\n\", 'semester, I think. I am planning to\\n', 'record the lectures, but as I said, posting lecture recordings\\n', 'is going to be a privilege. If students stop showing\\n', 'up to in-person lectures, I might withhold posting\\n', \"lecture recordings. That's it. I will always make exceptions under specific circumstances, like exceptional circumstances. But please show up to\\n\", 'lecture in person. Lecture recordings will be\\n', 'posted on the course website. How many of you got\\n', 'a chance to take a look at the course\\n', 'website already? Roughly half of\\n', 'you, so I sent out a Canvas announcement with a\\n', \"link to the course website. It's still work in progress. I know that some of the links haven't been\\n\", \"updated they might be still, or I'm still going\\n\", 'through the process of checking that everything\\n', \"is up to date. I'll make sure by end of today that almost everything\\n\", 'is up to date. So that has to do with\\n', 'the lecture logistics. Let me talk about reading. So first of all, the readings\\n', 'are going to be optional. The lecture content will cover all of the materials\\n', 'that you will be tested on. So basically, it will be self-contained\\n', \"lecture materials. In addition to lecture content, if you're interested in reading\\n\", 'more and learning more. These three books\\n', 'are going to be the primary sources of lecture content\\n', \"that I'll be using. First one is Fundamentals\\n\", 'of Data Engineering by Joe Reis and Matt Housley. ORE books can be easily accessed online if you\\n', \"have a library card. If you're coming in from 544, you might already be\\n\", 'familiar with it. If not, I can share\\n', \"some information. I'll probably create a post on Piazza about how to get\\n\", 'access to a library card. Data Breaks book is\\n', 'free for download, as most of you might know, majority of the Data\\n', 'Breaks resources are open source and available easily for all of you to access. So the second source\\n', 'is going to be Big Book of Data Engineering. And the last one is going to be Data Engineering with\\n', \"Python by Paul Cricket. Actually, that'll\\n\", 'be the main book that majority of the content\\n', 'is going to come from. The order is reversed. Let me talk about the\\n', \"course website logistics. I've given you a link\\n\", 'to the course website. The course website\\n', 'is going to contain information like what\\n', 'is the schedule, what is the course\\n', 'content, and the syllabus. Please read through\\n', \"the syllabus. As part of the syllabus, I've mentioned when\\n\", 'the mid-term exam is going to be held. Since this is a\\n', 'brand-new course, I do not have set deadlines\\n', \"for the projects. We'll talk about the\\n\", \"project shortly. We'll also talk\\n\", 'about the deadlines of the projects as well. First, let me talk\\n', 'about quiz deadlines. Typically, quizzes\\n', \"are assigned on Monday and they'll be\\n\", 'due on Wednesdays. You can find information about quest deadlines already\\n', 'on the schedule page, even though the content has\\n', \"not been populated yet. I've populated the\\n\", 'quiz deadlines. Project deadlines,\\n', 'unlike quiz deadlines, are going to depend on\\n', \"the content coverage. So I haven't really populated\\n\", 'the project deadlines yet. The very first\\n', 'project is going to be very similar to\\n', \"the first project that 544 asks you to complete in case you're\\n\", 'coming in from 544 background, it should easy for\\n', \"you to finish P1. Even if you're not coming\\n\", 'in from 544 background, Project 1 is going\\n', \"to be fairly easy. I've given you GitHub\\n\", 'repository link, although I do have a\\n', 'note on P1 stating, do not get started\\n', 'because we are still working on making edits to it. So the GitHub repository\\n', \"is also going to have lecture code that I'll be posting most likely\\n\", 'before the lecture. I always prefer to post the code before the\\n', 'lecture rather than after along with the project specification\\n', 'and other details. The third website, which\\n', 'is of significance, which I hope all of you will\\n', \"bookmark is going to be Canvas because you can access everything else from Canvas. I'll be using Canvas for\\n\", 'class-wide announcement. Please make sure to turn on email notifications so that\\n', \"you get notified immediately. And also, I'll be using it for\\n\", 'sending personal messages, for instance, like your exam\\n', \"grades and things like that. Canvas will also be the place where you'll\\n\", \"be taking quizzes, and you'll also get\\n\", 'your grade points or grade summaries\\n', \"as part of Canvas. Let me go over this slide and then I'll pause for questions. Few other resources\\n\", 'that you should know. Piazza is a platform\\n', 'for asking questions. Since all of you are in an upper-level computer\\n', \"science/data science course. I'm hoping that by now\\n\", \"you would have had exposure to Piazza somewhere. So it's a collaborative\\n\", \"platform. I'm hoping that all of you\\n\", 'will help each other learn. So the goal for\\n', 'Piazza is not about TS or me stepping in and\\n', \"answering question immediately, rather it's about all\\n\", 'of you using it as a collaborative platform\\n', 'to help each other out when one person\\n', \"has a question. So rule of thumb, don't post project\\n\", \"code on Piazza. Lecture code, it's always okay\\n\", \"to post, but project code, if you post that, that's going to hinder other\\n\", \"people's learning. There's a reason I'm not mentioning don't post less\\n\", 'than five lines of code, which is typically what the\\n', 'CS courses expect you to do. The main reason for that\\n', \"is because we're going to have the second project\\n\", 'fully about MySQL. So as all of you know, some of the project\\n', 'questions will literally be a\\n', \"single line of code, and I don't want all of you\\n\", 'to give away the answer to other folks by\\n', 'posting it on Piazza. Office hours is where you get individual\\n', \"questions answered. For now, since it's a small\\n\", \"course, relatively speaking, I've had my 3TA set up approximately two hours\\n\", \"of office hours per week. We'll see how the demand is, and then accordingly, we'll increase the number\\n\", 'of office hours. So if any of you feel the necessity to have\\n', 'additional office hours, always, please reach out. Either just drop me an\\n', 'email or post about it on the Piazza if you want to be anonymous to the\\n', \"rest of the class. Feel free to escalate issues by copying me to any email thread. Also, if you're contacting\\n\", 'multiple people. There are four people in\\n', 'the staff, including me, make sure to keep everyone\\n', 'on the same thread. We will be using\\n', 'GitHub Classroom as a way of organizing all\\n', 'of your repositories. Each of you, by each of you, I mean, either individually\\n', \"or as a group of two, you'll be given a private\\n\", \"repository for each project, and you'll turn in your code. The expectation\\n\", 'for this course is that you should know\\n', 'basic Git commands. How many of you\\n', 'have had background with some version\\n', \"control system before? Majority if you're\\n\", \"raising your hands. If you're not\\n\", 'raising your hands, please take some time to teach yourself basic Git commands. Any questions about any of the logistics so far? Question. >> Can you talk a little\\n', \"bit about the format of the exams? >> Format of the exams. That's a really good question. I'm still debating about\\n\", 'whether I should have multiple choice exams or\\n', \"written exams. How about this? Let's all put a pen on that. And two weeks from now, when I talk more about the\\n\", \"progress that we've made, I'll keep the class\\n\", 'informed about what kind of exams\\n', \"we're going to have. Does sound like a good plan. Any other questions? Questions. >> How about submissions? >> Sorry. >> How do we submit assignments? >> It's going to be\\n\", \"via GitHub Classroom. You'll have your own\\n\", 'private repository, you check in the code and\\n', \"we'll have access to it. That's it. Checking in\\n\", 'the code is submission. So grade components. Majority of the grade is going to come from\\n', \"programming projects. We'll have eight programming\\n\", 'projects, worth 6% each. Maximum group size\\n', 'is going to be two. Often I get asked this question. Can I change my partner\\n', 'between Project 1 and Project 2 or Project 2\\n', 'and Project 3 and so on? The answer is always yes. Collaboration comes from\\n', \"mutual understanding. If you don't have that\\n\", \"mutual understanding, then it's going to be really\\n\", \"difficult to collaborate. I'm hoping that most of you\\n\", 'will choose to collaborate. Even if you want to work on\\n', 'the project individually, I would still\\n', \"encourage all of you to find a project partner. It's okay to work on the\\n\", \"project individually, but at least you'll\\n\", 'still have someone to talk to if you have\\n', 'any questions, so as to not only to\\n', \"rely on the stuffing. We'll have 12 quizzes, 1% worth each open\\n\", 'material, open interpreter. You can use any resources. You can take quizzes with other students at the same time. The only thing that\\n', \"I ask that you all don't do is if you have\\n\", \"finished the quiz, don't tell what the answers\\n\", 'are to somebody else, that would just make it unfair to both of you, to be honest. Exams are not worth 48%. That is a mistake. I will fix that. My apologies. Exams as you can\\n', 'see are worth 35%. Mid-term is going to be 15% and final exam is\\n', 'going to be worth 20%, 5% of the grade is going to\\n', 'count towards participation. Top hat will be 2%\\n', 'out of those 5%. I will not be dropping\\n', 'top hat score. Other participation grades are\\n', 'going to come from survey, Piazza contribution, and so on. Any other questions about the\\n', 'grade components before we dive into data\\n', 'management? Questions. >> Are there any drops on the\\n', \"assignments or the quizzes? >> As of now, I don't\\n\", 'plan to have any. Mainly because the\\n', 'programming projects is where you actually get\\n', \"hands-on learning experience. So typically CS courses don't drop programming\\n\", 'projects and no drops in quizzes\\n', \"because they're open material, and honestly, I feel like all of\\n\", \"you should be taking the quizzes on time to make sure that you're\\n\", 'able to keep up with the course flow. Question. >> For the Piazza contribution, for full points how much\\n', \"contribution will you expect? >> That's a really\\n\", 'good question. Even just like posting a question once,\\n', 'meaningful question. Let me make it clear or giving a meaningful\\n', 'student answer, that counts. Just even one. By meaningful student answer, we will have the staffing team, including myself,\\n', 'endorse student answers. So it needs to be\\n', 'endorsed by us. As we were talking, at the beginning of\\n', \"today's lecture, the world is right\\n\", 'now filled with data. So what exactly do we need to\\n', 'know about data management? It is a series of processes\\n', 'that you need to go through. First of all, you\\n', 'need to figure out what is the source of your data, where are we going to\\n', 'collect the data from. So the first stage of\\n', 'data management is always data collection\\n', \"and data ingestion. And then once you have the data, not all of the data is usable. That's the problem\\n\", 'with raw data. You have ton of data. You need to work on\\n', 'cleaning the data or perform transformation\\n', 'on the data. Cleaning might\\n', 'include things like filtering or\\n', 'transformation steps would include things\\n', \"like normalization, aggregation, and so on. Let's talk about\\n\", 'the other aspects, which might be new to you. So the next stage that we all\\n', 'need to worry about once we have cleaned up for\\n', 'transformed data is, how exactly are we going to store or organize\\n', 'that particular data? So the first part of this might look familiar\\n', 'to most of you. The traditional way\\n', 'of storing data used to be in a relational\\n', 'form that is relational data, and traditionally\\n', 'relational data is stored in some SQL format. The most famous one\\n', 'being MySQL here. So we will be spending\\n', 'two or three lectures, learning about MySQL\\n', 'and how to use MySQL to store traditional\\n', 'transactional-based data. Another database which\\n', \"you might or might not be familiar with is NoSQL database, which is typically used to store non-relational data and we'll be covering MongoDB in\\n\", 'order to learn how exactly NoSQL data\\n', \"storage works. So that's a traditional way\\n\", \"of looking at data storage. Historically, that's\\n\", 'where various companies and organizations have been storing data inside databases. Then once people\\n', 'started to have more and more of terabytes\\n', 'and terabytes of data, they started moving on\\n', 'to other solutions. One such solution is something called this\\n', 'data warehousing. Data warehousing is a\\n', 'centralized repository where you can store\\n', 'structured data. So data comes in very\\n', 'different formats. It can either be structured, semi structured, or\\n', 'completely unstructured. So if you have a proper\\n', 'structure for your data, then data warehouse would\\n', 'be a really good place to put collective data into\\n', 'from multiple sources. Examples of data warehouses\\n', 'include Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, again, not\\n', 'an exhaustive list, just a couple of examples. So data warehouses are\\n', 'extremely optimized for transactional\\n', 'analysis for querying and reporting on\\n', 'transaction-based data, that is otherwise known\\n', \"as row-based data. So that's the second solution when it comes to data\\n\", 'storage or organization. You have another option, which is data lakes.\\n', '[NOISE] We spoke about how data warehouses are\\n', 'super helpful as a centralized place to\\n', 'store structured data. So the counterpart of that for unstructured and\\n', 'semi structured data is typically going\\n', \"to be data lakes. So you have tons of data. Again, we're talking\\n\", 'about data coming in from multiple sources in the raw or unstructured or\\n', 'semi structured format. It could even be used to store\\n', 'structured data as well. That will depend on the kind of application that\\n', \"you're trying to build with the data\\n\", 'for analytics. So data lakes, unlike data warehouses are ideal\\n', 'for big data analytics and machine learning kind of\\n', 'activity where you have a ton of rod or unstructured data\\n', 'that you need to work with. A couple of examples\\n', 'of data lakes include Google Cloud Storage and\\n', 'Azure Data Lake Storage. The next data organization\\n', \"and storage is the next step once you've cleaned up the\\n\", \"data or transformed the data. After you do that, let's\\n\", 'say that you still have multiple sources of data. Not everything can fit into the exact same warehouse\\n', \"or exact same data lake. That's when you have\\n\", 'a new stage called data integration and fusion. So typically when you hear about the term data integration, the most commonly\\n', 'encountered term is something called ETL which, stands for extract\\n', 'transform load. So data integration\\n', 'is about, once again, like accumulating data\\n', 'from multiple sources and extracting all of the data\\n', 'and transforming the data, which will look very similar\\n', 'to the cleaning stage. It can be about\\n', 'cleaning up the data by filtering or\\n', 'transforming the data by doing aggregation\\n', \"normalization, those kind of steps. Once you transform the data, you're going to go\\n\", \"through the load step where you're going to load the data into some kind\\n\", 'of storage structure, which can either be a traditional database\\n', 'or a data warehouse. ETL typically is going to be storing data in a\\n', 'structured manner. The reason for that is\\n', 'you are going through transformation to create\\n', 'that particular structure. So ETL is highly effective\\n', 'for storing data, which is structured from multiple sources\\n', 'and ensuring that all of the data is consistent,\\n', \"accurate, and reliable. So that's going to be the\\n\", 'topmost goal for ETL. Just like ETL, you have\\n', 'something similar called ELT. Most of you might have\\n', 'heard of the term ETL. ETL is not that\\n', \"different from ELT. As the name suggest, you're going to load the data before you perform\\n\", \"the transformation. So typically, you'll be\\n\", \"loading the data onto a data lake because you'll\\n\", 'have unstructured or raw data. [NOISE] So examples of ETL based systems\\n', \"include Apache NiFi. I don't know how exactly to say that. I'm\\n\", 'going to learn that. And another example\\n', 'would be Apache Airflow, and examples of ELT kind of systems would be Google\\n', 'BigQuery or Spark. So integration has to do with\\n', 'collecting data altogether. So what exactly is fusion? Those terms look too similar. Fusion is nothing but integration followed by\\n', 'additional steps of reduction. Like the reduction could depend on individual application needs. You might not need\\n', \"all of the data, so you're going to do further filtering by doing\\n\", \"the reduction process. That's what the data\\n\", \"fusion step means. So once we're able to\\n\", 'get all of the data together into a single location, then you need to\\n', 'worry about something called this data governance. So majority of the\\n', 'companies, nowadays, which have a business\\n', 'model that circles around managing data need to worry\\n', 'about data governance. So what exactly is\\n', \"data governance? First of all, you need to assure that the data is accurate, reliable, and complete. So that's going to be a primary goal for\\n\", 'all of the companies. You have a ton of\\n', 'data out there. How do you know that\\n', 'you can actually rely on the results that you\\n', 'get from your analysis? The only way to\\n', 'make sure of that is to ensure that your\\n', 'data is of high quality. So often companies will have prewritten rules about\\n', 'how exactly data from multiple sources can\\n', 'be integrated into a single storage\\n', 'system that either being data warehouses\\n', \"or data lakes. So you're going to have to always make sure\\n\", 'that those rules are not broken when you go through the data storage and\\n', 'integration steps. Other things, for companies\\n', \"to worry about data security, you need to always ensure that you're preventing\\n\", 'unauthorized access. A lot of information out there is personalized\\n', \"information, so it's very important that we ensure that data is secure, either by doing some\\n\", 'form of encryption or by having access control or doing both for that matter. The last thing that companies usually worry about,\\n', 'they have to, their kind of force nowadays is something called\\n', 'this data compliance. So there are now\\n', 'laws that govern how exactly companies\\n', \"can collect, store, and process data. I'm sure most of you\\n\", 'would have heard about at least one or\\n', 'two lawsuits that have been filed against\\n', 'Google and Facebook, which are the companies\\n', 'which have most of our data for having\\n', 'broken compliance rules. So compliance rules depend on where exactly the\\n', \"data is being stored. I've given you a\\n\", 'couple of examples. You have compliance\\n', 'standards like GDPR, which is general data\\n', 'protection regulation. And then you have HIPAA, which is Health Insurance Portability and\\n', \"Accountability Act. And if you're specifically\\n\", 'storing data in California, you have California\\n', 'Consumer Privacy Act, CCPA. So the objective that all of the businesses\\n', 'which work with data and data has to get some\\n', 'sort of insight from data, that is when they have a business model\\n', 'associated with data, they always need\\n', \"to make sure that they have data compliance. So that's another aspect of data management that all\\n\", 'of us need to worry about. Next thing which I want to talk about is data orchestration. Data orchestration is actually very similar to\\n', 'data integration, but it goes one step further. The first step about orchestrating data is\\n', 'about data integration. So what exactly are silos? When a company has\\n', 'multiple data warehouses, each of those warehouses might\\n', 'be completely independent. It might be very difficult to actually integrate\\n', \"them together. That's where data\\n\", \"orchestration solutions are going to be super helpful. They're going to be able to integrate data from\\n\", 'multiple silos. Other than integrating data, they go one step further by performing additional tasks like data mapping, data modeling, and they also offer\\n', 'data governance, which are offered\\n', 'by other kind of tools as well that\\n', \"made me realize, I didn't go over the couple of tools that I had on this slide. For data governance,\\n\", 'you can use tools like Collibra and Informatica. So why is data\\n', 'orchestration significant? Because, data\\n', 'orchestration, which combines data from within\\n', 'the company which have, completely different\\n', 'organizations in the form of individual silos into\\n', 'a single location, which makes it ideal for\\n', 'real time data analysis, which might be\\n', 'required depending on what kind of application\\n', \"that you're working on. The last aspect that I want to talk about is data cataloging. So data orchestration brings\\n\", 'all of this data together, tons and tons of data. How exactly do companies manage the information\\n', 'associated with all of the data that they\\n', 'have been collecting and accumulating using the\\n', \"data management processes? That's where data cataloguing\\n\", 'is going to come into play. Metadata management might\\n', \"look familiar to most of you. You've encountered\\n\", 'Metadata management at some level, at least. It has to do with storing some kind of\\n', 'description associated with whatever format of data\\n', \"storage that you're using. You could also use it\\n\", 'to classify your data and also create lineage of data, how one warehouse is related\\n', 'to another, and so on. Of course, the other\\n', 'aspect of data cataloging is actually\\n', 'documenting the data itself, mentioning what your\\n', 'sources of the data are. How is your data structured? How is the preprocessing done? Basically, pretty much anything that will ensure transparency, and it will provide any\\n', 'data scientist out there an opportunity to be able to reproduce what you already have. Examples of data\\n', 'cataloging based systems, a couple of them are AWS\\n', 'Glue and Apache Atlas. Any questions about any of the terminology that we\\n', \"have covered so far? So we've discussed all\\n\", \"of these terminology, and I've gone through a\\n\", \"bunch of tools that enable us to go through those kind of management related activity. We're not going to exactly be learning each one of the tools that I've listed on the slide. When we arrive at a point of the semester where\\n\", \"we're going to cover that particular topic. By then, I will\\n\", \"have decided what exactly is going to be the tool that we're\\n\", 'going to be covering. That said, let me go over\\n', \"the tentative topic list. So we're going to be spending at least a couple of\\n\", 'lectures covering basic Linux commands and also\\n', 'basics of Docker commands. We will be using Docker\\n', 'environment to get all of you to develop your programming for any of the systems that\\n', 'you built in there. Due to a couple of reasons, one, Docker enables us to have consistent\\n', 'development environment. All of us will be\\n', 'on the same page, that will tend to avoid\\n', 'system-based issues, which is such a pain\\n', 'always to debug. And the second\\n', 'reasoning for using Docker is it is very\\n', 'easy for the TAs to grade all of your work if all of the production or development is being done inside\\n', \"Docker containers. So we're going to spend a couple of lectures on those topics. And then we will move on to learning more about\\n\", 'relational database. And then the second project is going to be based on\\n', \"the topic of SQL. Then after that, I'm hoping to move on to the No SQL topic. The third project is going\\n\", \"to be based on MongoDB. At least that's the futuristic\\n\", \"plan that I have so far. And then I'm hoping\\n\", 'to cover some of the aspects of the\\n', 'data management topics that we discussed\\n', 'a few slides ago, that will include data\\n', \"warehouses, data lakes, and we'll also be learning about semantic layer\\n\", \"and knowledge graph. Specifically, I'm hoping to\\n\", \"cover Apache Iceberg system. And we'll talk about differences\\n\", \"between ETL and ELT, and we'll also talk about how companies develop\\n\", 'data pipelines. That is going to be\\n', 'the primary task of data scientists and majority\\n', \"of the businesses out there. And then after that, we'll move on to\\n\", 'learning about how to do predictive analysis\\n', 'using boosting techniques and using\\n', \"time series techniques. Time permitting, I'm hoping to spend at least like one lecture on vector databases and also hopefully a lecture\\n\", \"on prompt engineering. We'll see at the\\n\", \"end of the semester how things look like. And we'll also be covering advanced visualization\\n\", 'topics like how to produce sunburst plots, how to create dashboards, how to do data\\n', \"storytelling, and so on. So that's going to\\n\", 'be the tentative topic list for the semester. And again, because the\\n', 'topic list is tentative, tentative course learning\\n', \"objectives as well, I've listed the course\\n\", 'learning objectives here, as well as part of the syllabus. I would encourage\\n', 'all of you to go through the course\\n', 'learning objectives, and also the learning\\n', 'objective for every lecture so as\\n', 'to be able to assess your learning that\\n', \"you're getting from the lecture and also\\n\", \"from the overall course. I'm not going to go\\n\", 'over individual course learning objectives.\\n', \"Before I bring up the top hat question, once again, it's\\n\", 'only for practice. Let me ask all of\\n', 'you any questions at all about the overall\\n', \"plan for the semester. I'm going to bring up\\n\", 'top hat in a minute. But before that, let me go\\n', 'over the action item slide. I would actually recommend\\n', \"you to set up your GCPVM. I'll be sending you instructions\\n\", \"as to how to do that, definitely by tomorrow morning, if not by today. If you're coming in\\n\", 'from 400 background, I would definitely\\n', 'encourage you to set up the VM sooner\\n', 'rather than later so as to enable you to get some practice in advance\\n', \"with Python programming.

Any issues with top hat\\n', \"at all, any concerns? Awesome. Let's wrap up\\n\", 'the first lecture here. I will see all of you on Friday.']\n",

Happy first\\n\", 'day of classes. I hope all of you are excited\\n', 'for this new semester. Welcome to CS 639: Data\\n', 'Management for Data Science. You all get to be the lucky\\n', 'group because this is the first time ever I am\\n', 'offering this course. So that would mean that you will get to have a lot more\\n', 'say about what kind of things that you learn\\n', 'as part of this course than you would with a\\n', \"fully developed course. That's sad. Let's talk about what exactly\\n\", 'is data management. We all know that the world is now drowning in an\\n', 'abundance of data. A year or so ago,\\n', \"I would have said, human data now it's no\\n\", 'longer just human data. As we all know, the hot topic anywhere that you turn\\n', 'today is generative AI.

So what exactly do we\\n', 'mean by data management? It is very critical that\\n', 'companies figure out how exactly they can process the\\n', 'trillions and trillions of bytes of data that is being generated on a day to day basis. Raw data in a direct\\n', 'sense is money, nowadays. Why? Because you can transform raw data to gain insights\\n', 'and knowledge from it, and from the knowledge, you can convert that into\\n', \"direct business value. That's how companies are\\n\", \"thriving these days. They're trying to leverage data as their main source\\n\", 'of business model. What exactly is data management? Data management is the\\n', 'process of collecting, ingesting,\\n', \"transforming, storing, organizing the data in such a way that you're\\n\", 'actually able to derive meaningful insights from all of the data that you have; the ton of the data\\n', 'that you have.

So we'll talk about SSH shortly. Meanwhile, any questions\\n\", 'on how to create the VM or how to set up the SSH key to\\n', \"be able to connect to it? Today's lecture is going to\\n\", 'cover basic Linux commands. Most of you will be familiar with a subsection\\n', 'of these commands, but I still need to\\n', 'go through these for the purpose of students who have no prior Linux background. So here are the learning\\n', \"objectives for today's lecture. We're going to learn how to navigate files and directories, otherwise known as folders\\n\", \"on a Linux file system. Also, we're going\\n\", 'to learn how to operate commands\\n', 'using Linux Shell, which is a program\\n', 'in and itself. And then whenever we\\n', 'can type something, there is always room\\n', \"for automation. We're going to learn how to\\n\", 'automate repeated tasks. Shell commands are really good about doing one particular task. That is one command is usually associated with doing\\n', 'a specific task. How do you actually\\n', \"get Shell commands to do complex tasks? You'll be chaining\\n\", \"one Shell command with another and so on. So we're going to learn\\n\", 'how to chain multiple Shell commands together to\\n', \"create a pipeline of commands. And then we'll also be learning how to\\n\", 'redirect the output of a process to a file instead of having it directed\\n', 'to standard output. So what exactly is Shell? Shell is nothing but\\n', 'a simplistic program. If you have already\\n', 'completed 537 course, which is the intro to\\n', 'operating system course, it is likely that you would have written your own\\n', 'version of Shell. Shell is something which is\\n', \"very easy for you to write. It's nothing but a\\n\", 'program which runs in a constant loop\\n', \"or an infinite loop. It'll constantly prompt the\\n\", \"user to enter some command, and then it'll obtain that\\n\", 'command as an input and run that particular command\\n', 'for that particular user. So you can have two\\n', 'different ways of entering input into a Shell. You can either use the\\n', 'traditional way of typing a command into a Shell by using your keyboard or you\\n', 'could write a Shell script, which typically\\n', 'has a.s extension and put your Shell commands in there and automate your task. So why exactly is\\n', 'Shell super useful, not only does enable you to run commands on your local\\n', 'laptop or your computer, it also enables you to run\\n', 'commands on a remote computer. All of us are going to be using the GCP virtual machine\\n', 'as a remote computer. So we need to have\\n', 'a way to be able to actually connect to\\n', \"our virtual machine, and that's where SSH is\\n\", 'going to come into play. SSH stands for Secure Shell. Since Shell is a\\n', 'program that runs other programs, within Shell, you can even invoke other Shells that includes the special\\n', 'case of being able to invoke a remote connection to a remote machine using\\n', \"the Secure Shell command, which in short is SSH. So let's directly\\n\", \"dive into demo. The first command that we're\\n\", 'going to go through today is how to SSH into our\\n', 'GCP virtual machine. Question, everybody in the back, can you see the screen?\\n', \"Awesome. Thank you. So the format for S, that's what usually\\n\", 'computer scientists refer to as establishing\\n', \"SSH session. Often they'll say\\n\", 'SSHing into a machine. The command to SSHing\\n', 'into a machine is going to be SSH,\\n', 'username@IP address. We have two different complains we need to figure out here. What is going to\\n', 'be the username? What is going to\\n', 'be the IP address. Let me switch back\\n', 'to my browser.

If there is a need for\\n', \"you to learn details, you'll learn at some point\\n\", 'during this semester. We will be using\\n', 'the external IP to establish connection\\n', 'between our laptop and the remote virtual machine. So you can copy the external\\n', 'IP and paste it onto your terminal over here and Once you have your SSH\\n', 'key properly established, it will prompt you to accept\\n', \"the SSH key fingerprint.

Any questions on how to SSH\\n', \"onto your virtual machine? >> So now I'm in my virtual\\n\", \"machine, as you can see, I've named my\\n\", 'instance CS639-small, and Syam Kumar is my username. How do I exit this session? I can either press \"Exit\" or I can press \"Control\\n', 'D\" in order to go back In terms of looking up the\\n', \"commands that you've already typed on your terminal. You can use up arrow, which will enable you to look up the previously used command. So I'm going to go back into\\n\", \"my SSH session over here, and I'm going to\\n\", 'demonstrate Control D, which is exactly the same as typing exit on your keyboard. So learning keyboard shortcuts is going to make all\\n', \"of your lives easier. Majority of the times you'll be spending your time on terminal, if you're not\\n\", 'writing Python code inside a Jupiter\\n', \"Notebook session. So we'll learn about the\\n\", 'CAT command shortly. SSH is the very first command that I wanted to go through. One other command that I\\n', 'want to go through in terms of being able to do\\n', 'a history search. Let me exit this session. Oops, I actually\\n', 'exited my terminal, my pad, Let me actually\\n', 'close that session. So let me use Control R. If you press Control R that enables you to do a reverse history search.

That's one other way\\n\", 'that you can make the whole process of SSHing\\n', 'into your machine faster. Another thing that you could\\n', 'do is you could actually create an alias for\\n', 'the SSH command, make it look shorter and\\n', 'type just that short part in order to be able to\\n', \"connect to the VM faster. I'm not going to go through\\n\", \"how to create alias, that's going to be to do for\\n\", 'all of you to figure out. You can just google\\n', \"how to create an alias for the SSH command. So let's go through\\n\", \"more commands here. I'm going to first show you\\n\", \"what the clear command does, that's going to clear\\n\", 'the entire screen for me so that we can\\n', \"start from scratch.

If I click on \"F24\", that will take me to the\\n', 'base of the repository. If I click on the code\\n', 'link here and then navigate to HTTPS section, I can copy this command, and the command to clone a Git repository is Git clone followed by the\\n', 'URL of the repository. So how do I know this\\n', 'repository has been cloned? First of all, I need to\\n', 'figure out where I am, which should be the\\n', 'thing that you should do before even you clone\\n', 'the repository. The command to\\n', 'figure out where you are is something called a PWD, which stands for print\\n', 'working directory. Let me just type that out. I can write a comment\\n', 'on shell just like how I can write a comment\\n', 'on a Python line of code. # stands for a comment. I am in my home directory, which is /home [NOISE] followed\\n', 'by my username over here. So how do I know that the\\n', 'clone was successful? I can execute the LS command, which enables us\\n', 'to list files and directories inside the\\n', 'current working directory. As you can see, there is\\n', 'a directory called f24, which corresponds to\\n', 'the Git repository that I just cloned. So every lecture before\\n', \"the start of the lecture, today's lecture being\\n\", 'the only exception, I would want you to\\n', 'do a Git pull on the repository so\\n', 'as to be able to get the lecture notes\\n', 'prior to the lecture.

So at this point, I want to start\\n', 'introducing how you can learn details associated\\n', 'with specific commands. For example, if you want to learn details about\\n', 'the head command, you can use head -- help, which will dump out\\n', 'the detailed arguments associated with\\n', 'the head command.

You definitely need to specify the flag name and not\\n', 'just the number of lines. So this is the correct answer. So that brings me\\n', 'to talking about, what do you do if you have\\n', 'technical issues with tophat. If you go to the course website\\n', \"and click on class forms, you'll notice that there\\n\", 'is a lecture misses form, which asks you to specify\\n', 'a particular reason.

I'm going to go back over here and demonstrate that command. So I'm going to just\\n\", 'press Apero over here, Head -n 20 spotify.CSV, that should give me 20 lines\\n', 'of just the first ten lines. So Head gives you the initial\\n', \"few lines of any file. Tail does the opposite. So if I say tail spotify.csv. That's going to give\\n\", 'me the last ten lines of spotify.csv. Another useful, option associated with tail\\n', 'is a flag called Hyphen F, which stands for follow.

So you can terminate\\n', 'this, once again, using Control C. So tail -F, very useful option\\n', 'for the tail command. So let me go ahead\\n', 'and clear my screen. Any questions about files\\n', 'at all? Yeah. Question. >> Can you explain that\\n', 'Hyphen n [inaudible]. >> Hyphen n enables you to\\n', 'specify the number of lines associated with the output of either the head\\n', 'or the tail command.

So LS - l option gives you list output of the same LS command\\n', 'with additional details. Couple of things that I\\n', 'want to go over here. You have this number column, which is showing up almost\\n', 'in the middle of the output. That indicates the size of each of the file\\n', 'and directory, hard for humans to read.

So if you actually\\n', 'want to take a look at all of the files\\n', \"in the directories, you'll have to ls - lah or lha. You can change the order of\\n\", 'the options as you see fit. Any questions about any of these options before\\n', 'we talk about other outputs as part\\n', \"of the detail listing. So size wasn't the only\\n\", 'thing that was listed here.

So within each of these\\n', 'three sets of permissions, you have something\\n', 'called this RWX, which stands for read,\\n', 'write, and execute. All of those should\\n', 'be self intuitive. What kind of permission\\n', 'level does each of those categories of people have on that particular\\n', 'file or directory. So let me talk about\\n', 'one example over here.

If this name bothers you, you can always use the\\n', 'Hyphen Hyphen name option when you launch the\\n', 'Docker container, using Docker Run to control\\n', 'the actual name that gets assigned to that particular\\n', \"docker container instance. So I'm going to say\\n\", \"Docker and then logs, that's going to be\\n\", 'the command name. And I need to mention the\\n', \"name of my container here. That's going to be\\n\", 'the first argument. I can just type MU\\n', 'and then type tab. Linux shell should\\n', 'autocomplete that for you. As you can see, the logs\\n', \"right now just show hello. That's because 300 seconds\\n\", \"is quite a long time. It's going to take forever for us to be able\\n\", 'to see the buy. So just like how you\\n', 'have tail Hyphen F, which stands for follow flag, which will enable\\n', 'you to keep track of the latest update on\\n', 'any Unix file system. Similar to that, you also have Docker Logs Hip and F flag. So if you do that,\\n', 'your Docker logs commands output will just stay hanging in there because\\n', \"it's just waiting for newer and newer update from that particular\\n\", 'containers execution. You can always exit from any command using\\n', 'the kill signal, which is control C.\\n', 'Any questions on docker logs before we\\n', 'move on to learning about Docker exec command. I am going to go ahead\\n', 'and clear my screen. As with the first few lectures, I would definitely\\n', 'recommend all of you to keep going through\\n', 'these commands after the lecture or\\n', 'during the lecture so that you get really good at being able to use all\\n', 'of these Docker commands. So we use Docker Run to launch a new container\\n', \"and run a new program. How can you run a new program in an existing container that's going to be the next\\n\", \"use case scenario. So we're going to use the\\n\", \"Docker exec command for that. As one might expect, you'll have to\\n\", 'provide the name of the container when you\\n', \"run Docker exec command. Recall that my container's\\n\", \"name was using a scoreboard, so I'm going to just type\\n\", \"M and then type tab. As with the run command, you're going to have to specify what program are\\n\", \"you trying to run? Let's run bash. Recall that if you\\n\", 'want to run bash, you need to use a\\n', 'hyphen IT flag, same location as\\n', 'the run command, you need to say docker\\n', 'exact hyphen IT. And then followed by which,\\n', \"you're going to have to say name of the container and\\n\", 'then the name of the program. So if I go ahead\\n', \"and press Enter now and let me execute PSAX, as you can see, I'm\\n\", 'inside the container now, and the shell program\\n', 'that we initiated, using the detached option for launching a container\\n', 'is still running. In here, you can do\\n', 'whatever you want. You can just check what are\\n', \"all the files in there. I'm going to go\\n\", 'ahead and exit from the exact commands\\n', \"session of this bash. So if I do this, the container is not going to get stopped? That's because,\\n\", \"remember, I'm using Docker exec command this time\\n\", 'and not Docker run command. If you press exit or control\\n', 'D from inside a docker run, which is not using\\n', \"detached mode, then you'll actually\\n\", \"stop the container. As opposed to that, when you exit from Docker exec execution, you're just like\\n\", 'stopping the program, which is bash over here and\\n', 'not the container itself. Any questions on docker run\\n', \"versus Docker exec? Question. >> [inaudible] >> Yes, it would. But I'm\\n\", 'not going to wait until then because I want to show you how the Docker kill\\n', \"command works. Any other questions? So let's go through\\n\", 'some more commands that will help you keep track\\n', \"of existing containers. I'm going to show you the\\n\", 'Docker Stats command, which is going to give\\n', 'you information about resource utilization that is happening as part of\\n', 'running Docker containers. You have the four top most utilize resources,\\n', 'which are CPU. Your RAM, otherwise\\n', 'known as memory. And then you have network IO, IO stands for input\\n', 'output and block IO, which indicates disk usage. So stats is another useful\\n', 'command for you to keep track of resource utilization\\n', 'by the docker containers. The next command that\\n', 'I want to show you is the last piece of the puzzle\\n', 'with respect to cleanup. What if you wanted to stop\\n', \"a running docker container. You'll be using the\\n\", \"kill command for that. And as usually, you're going to have to\\n\", 'specify the name of the docker container looks like my docker container\\n', \"already got terminated. Let me just use the upper row to again launch another one. Just give me one second. I'm going to have\\n\", \"to find its name. It'll be a different one. Loughing Newton. Nice name. So let me go back to the Stats command and show\\n\", 'you the output one more time. This time, you can\\n', 'actually see active output because I have an actively\\n', 'running container. What command do I have\\n', \"to use to kill this? I'll have to say docker kill, and then name of the\\n\", 'running container. So this will stop the container. This will not ensure that\\n', 'we remove the container. Docker Kill stops a\\n', 'running container. Docker remove will clean up any still resource usage by\\n', \"that particular container. So you're still\\n\", 'going to have to say Docker remove and then\\n', 'name of the container to actually get rid of all of the associated resources with respect to that\\n', 'particular container. Any questions about docker stats or docker kill or\\n', \"docker remote commands. So we're going to move on to learning how to write code\\n\", 'inside a docker file. So let me remind all\\n', 'of you that, uh, you need to be cloning the F24 repository on your VMs and doing a git pull at the beginning\\n', \"of every lecture. That's how you get access\\n\", 'to the code that I will be writing as\\n', 'part of the lecture. I already released the code for docker file as part\\n', 'of the previous lecture. I was hoping to cover these at the end of\\n', \"the previous lecture, but we quite couldn't\\n\", 'get to covering those. So you can follow along\\n', 'either by just using these versions of\\n', 'the file or you can type along with me\\n', \"whatever you see fit. Already have hello.py in here. I'll show you a use case\\n\", \"where you'll take a program, copy it into the container\\n\", \"that you're trying to launch. Before we get that far, let's first learn the basic\\n\", 'syntax of Dockerfile. Very simple syntax. You have four\\n', 'different commands. The first one, which\\n', 'is of significant, is going to be the from command, which is going to enable you to specify what is the\\n', 'base image from which you want to create your\\n', 'own custom docker build. Let me mention the\\n', 'base images up 224.04, up two colon and then you need\\n', 'to specify the tag number. And then you have\\n', 'the Run command, which enables you to\\n', 'run various commands on a Docker container before actually taking a snapshot of the container to generate\\n', 'the build for you. The very first command\\n', \"that you'd always want to run is to make sure that\\n\", \"Apt-get is up to date. So I'm going to say\\n\", \"run Apt-get update. And let me also use apt-get to let's say\\n\", \"install W, unzip. For now, let's just\\n\", \"install unzip. So that's all that I'm going\\n\", 'to put into my Docker file. Again, you have access to a more completed version\\n', 'of this file from, uh, the course, GitHub\\n', 'repository link. So once you create\\n', \"a Docker file, you're going to be\\n\", 'using the Docker built command to create\\n', 'your own custom build. So the command for\\n', 'that is Docker Built, and you need to\\n', 'specify the name of the directory within which\\n', 'you have Docker file and any of the associated programs that you want to copy over\\n', 'into your Docker container. Docker expects you to have all of that in a single location and provide that\\n', \"particular location as part of the first argument. I'm going to use the Docker file in my current working directory, so I'm just going\\n\", 'to use a dot here. And then you need to\\n', 'use a hyphen P flag. And then you need to\\n', 'mention the name of the image that you want the\\n', \"built process to create. For example, I'm going to type\\n\", \"demo here for project P1, you'll be typing P1 there. So as you can see, it's executing Apt-get update. Before it does snapshot, it also installs unzip. And then once it does that, you're going to be able to see that particular build in the Docker images\\n\", 'command output. So there is a demo\\n', 'belt that I can now use custom image that has been built\\n', 'using the belt command. So now I should be able to\\n', 'use Docker Run command to launch a new container using this particular custom\\n', 'image that I just built. For instance, I can say\\n', 'Docker Run Hyphen IT, and then I can say demo, and then I can run bash. I should now be inside the custom Docker image\\n', 'that I just built, which is supposed to\\n', 'contain unzip installation. Let me go ahead and\\n', 'exit from here. Any questions on the\\n', 'basic syntax of from and run before we move on to a\\n', 'combination of other things? One thing that I\\n', 'want to mention. Often developers would want to combine both the\\n', 'update command and the install command\\n', 'on the same line. And you can achieve\\n', 'that by using double and percent instead of\\n', 'having two run commands. You can just have a\\n', 'single run command where you have Apt-get update, and then immediately\\n', \"followed by Apt-get date, you'll try to do the\\n\", 'installations over here. Let me add a couple of\\n', \"other installations here. I'm going to try and\\n\", \"install Python 3, and then let's say\\n\", 'Python 3, Hyphen pip. Let me go ahead\\n', \"and save my file, and I'm going to\\n\", 'use my app here to create a newer\\n', \"version of the build. >> Now it's going to try and install more packages over here. And let's see what\\n\", 'that leads us to. So it gives us an error. What is the error bill? It says that it cannot successfully run the\\n', 'app get installed. Why? If you look\\n', \"up a little bit, notice that you're\\n\", 'actually being prompted as part of\\n', 'the installation. We all know that sometimes\\n', \"when you install, it'll prompt you whether you\\n\", 'want to continue or not. Is there a way for us to\\n', 'walk around this scenario? Yes. You can use the -y flag. Let me go back to Dockerfile. Instead of just saying install and then a list\\n', 'of things to install. You can say -y, and then the list of programs that you want to install within your\\n', 'Docker container. So if I go ahead and save this file and re-run\\n', \"my bill command now, this time it should go through. So it'll probably take a couple of minutes\\n\", 'for it to build. Meanwhile, any questions on the syntax of Dockerfile\\n', 'or the process of using the bill\\n', 'command to create your own custom image? Question. >> [inaudible]. >> For a specific scenario? Yes. Throughout the\\n', \"course of this semester, we'll be working with multiple\\n\", \"different Dockerfiles. Depends on what application that we're going to\\n\", \"currently focus on. So after today's lecture, we're going to move\\n\", \"on to the MSQL equal specific lectures where we'll be using a Dockerfile where\\n\", 'we install MSQL equal server, which is precisely YP one as DOT and figure out how to\\n', \"install MSQL server. But I'll also show\\n\", 'you how to do that. Any other questions? So this is going to take a few minutes for you to do because of the\\n', 'additional installs. Let me show you one thing. If I use the pero command and run the Bill command\\n', 'again, immediately. Notice that it\\n', \"finishes instantly. That's because the outcome\\n\", 'of the bill process is actually cached unless\\n', 'and until you actually make significant changes\\n', \"to the Dockerfile. It's actually not\\n\", 'going to produce a brand new image\\n', 'custom image for you. So, let me see. I had one other thing to go through with respect\\n', 'to installation. Give me a second. Let me open Dockerfile. Oh, actually, before that, let me use Docker\\n', 'Run command to open a bash session using the demo\\n', 'image that we just built. And I want to show\\n', \"you one command. So let's say that other than installing Python3 and PIP3, you want to install\\n\", 'Pandas package. Specifically, for some reason, you want to install\\n', 'Pandas version 2.1.2. The command to install\\n', 'Pandas version 2.1.2 is to say PIP3\\n', 'install Pandas, and then say double\\n', \"equal to 2.1.0. And notice that you're\\n\", \"running into an issue. It is saying that you're trying to do the installation\\n\", 'as a route, which PIP does not like. If you think this is a mistake, it is giving you a\\n', 'suggestion as to what flag to use to overcome\\n', \"this particular scenario. Often, you'd want to launch\\n\", 'a container and then open a bash program within your container and experiment\\n', 'with the installations, and then write your\\n', \"Dockerfile so that you're familiar with what\\n\", \"flags you would need. So let me copy this flag, and I'm going to exit, and let me go back\\n\", \"to my Dockerfile, and I'm going to type\\n\", 'my run command now. The run command is going\\n', 'to be PIP3 install Pandas, and then the version is 2.1.2. Once again, I need the\\n', 'flag-break system packages. So if I go ahead and use my Appero to\\n', \"repeat my bill command, you'll notice that the\\n\", 'Pandas installation will actually be successful. While we let the run, I am going to open a new\\n', 'tab and as SH into my VM. And give me a second to\\n', \"navigate to where I was. And let's take a\\n\", 'look at hello.py. Meanwhile, any questions on run or the from command within\\n', \"the Dockerfile syntax at all. So helllo.py simplistic program. I'm importing the Pandas\\n\", 'module with abbreviation SPD, just using print function call\\n', 'to display hello students, creating a small Pandas series with the numbers\\n', 'one, two and three, using some function to\\n', \"sum of those numbers, and that's going\\n\", 'to be the program that will be copying over to our container and actually running it\\n', \"within our container. You've been asked to do\\n\", 'something similar in Project P1. I would like to at this point, mention this one thing\\n', 'about count.sh in P one, that should be self contained, meaning that your WGT command\\n', 'and your N ZIP command, and whatever command\\n', \"that you're writing for searching for POP should\\n\", 'all be part of count.sh. And your count.sh should be\\n', 'copied inside your container, using the copy command, and you should be\\n', 'using the CMD command to run that inside\\n', \"the container. Make sure that you're doing\\n\", 'all of those steps correctly. And also, I would like\\n', 'to definitely take this moment to emphasize that we expect all of the students\\n', 'to run auto grader on their GCP VMs before they commit their files onto\\n', 'their GitHub repositories. All if you are in an\\n', 'upper level CS class. If we ask that you\\n', \"run your autograder, we trust that you will have run your autograder, and that, you'll not come to us by saying that what exactly\\n\", 'is an auto grader. Somebody answered this question. Where can you find the\\n', 'autograder for P1? Go for it. >> On the repository. >> On the repository. As part of the repository, instructions on the repository. Read me, tell you that you\\n', 'need to run autograder.py. Just make sure that\\n', \"you're following the provided steps\\n\", 'correctly and in detail. Any questions about hello.py? Oh, what do they do? Give me a second. This is why I have a completed\\n', \"version of the file. I don't know what I messed up, but I'm just going to copy the entire thing\\n\", \"over. You know what? While we're at it, I'll\\n\", 'copy the whole thing, and we can talk about\\n', 'the other two commands. So let me actually\\n', 'run the bill command. Because this will take\\n', \"some time for it to build. While it is building, let's open the file\\n\", 'and talk about the other things that\\n', \"we're doing here. I went over the\\n\", \"hello.py program. It's similar to what\\n\", \"you have with count.sh. So for both of those scenarios, we're going to use the\\n\", 'copy syntax as part of your Dockerfile to\\n', \"copy the local file over. As I mentioned, while you're\\n\", 'creating a docker build, all of the associated files should be in one\\n', 'particular directory. And I would prefer that to be my current\\n', 'working directory, so I have hello.py in here. Why is that significant? Because Docker does not actually recognize\\n', \"absolute parts. So you're going to have to have whatever file you want to copy over within the current\\n\", \"working directory where you're trying\\n\", 'to create the bill. I already have hello.py in my\\n', 'current working directory. On my docker container, I can choose any path to put\\n', 'that particular file into. You can choose\\n', 'whatever path you want to copy over your count.sh and use that particular\\n', \"path to run count.sh. For example, I'm\\n\", 'copying over hello,py into where slash Run over here. So this is now going to make sure that when I\\n', 'launch a container, it will actually come up with\\n', \"hello.py, copied inside, slash ware, slash run and that's one thing\\n\", 'that you need to do. The last piece of the\\n', 'puzzle is going to be the CMD syntax, which is going to\\n', \"enable you to actually execute that particular program. In this case, we're\\n\", 'going to have to specify Python3 and then\\n', \"hello.py, for instance, I'll have to specify Python3\\n\", \"hello.py probably will fail because I haven't installed Pandas on my virtual machine. I work with Docker\\n\", 'most of the time. But at least like we know\\n', \"the program is running, given that it's giving\\n\", 'us ModuleNotFoundError. So this is how you\\n', 'execute hello.py. If this were a shell script, we would say something\\n', 'like./hello.sh , which should work. Assuming you are using\\n', 'CH Mode command to provide executable permission\\n', 'for that particular file. So now, CMD command, if you have a single\\n', 'program name, you can simply mention that as one list item within a list, and Python list syntax is open square bracket\\n', 'close square bracket? If you have a program\\n', 'that takes arguments, for example, Python3, which requires you\\n', 'to pass the name of the program that you want\\n', \"to run as an argument, you're going to have to specify two items within the list. First one is going\\n\", 'to be the name of the program,\\n', 'which is Python3. Second one is going\\n', \"to be the argument, which in our case, it's going to be\\n\", '/var/run/hello.py. Any questions on the\\n', \"syntax of copy or command? I'm just going to\\n\", 'look over here. I have no idea what typo I made with the\\n', 'previous version. At least this version\\n', 'of the bill is working. So now that we have\\n', \"created the bill and also copied over hello.py inside, let's go ahead and\\n\", \"launch a new container. I'm going to use Docker\\n\", \"Run Command to do this. Docker run-it, and then I'm going to have to say\\n\", 'the name of the image, which is demo, and\\n', 'then let me say bash.

So I'm inside my\\n\", 'docker container now. I can do ls/var/run.

We're now going to switch\\n\", 'topics and move on to learning about relational\\n', 'database management systems. Before we dive into relational database\\n', \"management systems, let's first talk about what is meant by database\\n\", \"management systems. I have a few learning objectives lined up for all of you today. We're going to first\\n\", 'start discussing about the three\\n', 'different types of data. I mentioned the types\\n', 'of data as part of the first lecture\\n', \"as a passing point. We're now going to have\\n\", 'detailed discussions about three different\\n', 'types of data, which are structured,\\n', \"semi-structured and unstructured, otherwise known as raw. And then we'll move\\n\", 'on to understanding the fundamentals of database\\n', \"management systems. Then let's learn\\n\", 'the definition of schema along with three\\n', \"different abstraction types. And we'll identify\\n\", 'various types of database management\\n', \"systems with examples. We'll also learn the\\n\", 'difference between OLAP and OLTP systems. Finally, well on how to identify primary keys\\n', 'and foreign keys given a schema to a\\n', 'particular RDPMS table. First of all, three different types of data, structured data, semi structured data,\\n', \"unstructured data, otherwise known as raw data. Let's talk about the differences between all three of those. First of, structured data. Structured data is something\\n\", 'that has high level of organization and some form of indexing associated with it. The use case here is\\n', \"to make sure that you're able to\\n\", 'easily use the data, for querying, for\\n', 'doing any searches, aggregation, in any\\n', 'analysis for that matter. The data, when it comes to structured type is going to\\n', 'conform to a strict schema, later on, we define what\\n', 'exactly is meant by a schema. Just at a high level, schema is going to control\\n', 'some predefined format, typically a table format, not essentially always table, that will enable you to\\n', 'ensure that you have high level of organization\\n', 'of your structured data. Examples of structured\\n', 'data include tables in a database or even\\n', 'Spreadsheets for that matter. >> Structured enough\\n', 'for us to consider them as structured data. All of you should be very\\n', 'familiar with structured data. Now, what is\\n', 'semi-structured data? Your data will have\\n', 'some structure, but there will be no rigid formating or the formatting will be\\n', \"implicit and irregular. So that's going to\\n\", 'be the definition for semi-structured data. As opposed to structured data, semi-structured\\n', 'data is going to be flexible easy for you to store and pase relatively\\n', 'when compared to unstructured or raw data. Because of the flexibility, you have an option to\\n', 'flexibly define schema. For instance, you can control the predefined structure\\n', 'over here rather than having strict schema with strict column details\\n', \"and things like that. You'll be having an implicit\\n\", 'or irregular structure with things like tags, markers that separate\\n', 'various semantic elements, parts of your data. So your flexible schema is\\n', 'going to help you to enforce some level of hierarchy of\\n', \"the fields within the data, hence the semi-structured, and it's not like\\n\", 'completely hand wavy. So good examples of semi\\n', 'structured data include JSON, HTML, XML, even email\\n', 'for that matter, you have some amount of\\n', \"structure for an email. You're from address to address\\n\", 'and unstructured part, which is going to be the subject and content of the email. So we are left with\\n', 'the third category of type of data, which\\n', 'is unstructured. In this category, data does not conform to any specified format. Neither does it have any\\n', 'predefined structure. So typically, unstructured\\n', 'data is stored in the form of objects or\\n', 'directly on the file system. This is extremely hard to query and also hard to maintain, but it is very much valuable. Let me give you a couple of\\n', 'examples of unstructured data that could include things like text documents, word files, syllabus page from this\\n', 'course or any other course, PDF files of the\\n', 'lecture slide content, and also things like multimedia, files, like images, audio, video, whatever\\n', 'you can think of. Also, the most relevant thing for majority of you in here, example of unstructured data\\n', 'include social media posts, like blog post, Facebook post, X platform posts, previously\\n', 'known as Tweets, and so on. So given that, it is extremely hard for you to store and\\n', 'query unstructured data, why would unstructured\\n', 'data be very valuable? Can any of you\\n', 'think of a current, to the date application\\n', 'for unstructured data? >> LLMs. >> LLMs large language models. A year before now, I would\\n', 'have struggled to give you probably an example that all\\n', 'of you can connect with. Quite literally, we can take\\n', 'all of the content from my course website and train\\n', 'an LLM model on that content, and I can create an AI\\n', 'based tutor just for 639. Actually, my grad student worked on a similar\\n', 'research project, which is currently ongoing. So unstructured data nowadays, has the most value\\n', 'because of the advances that AI folks have made\\n', 'in the field of LLMs. Any questions on three\\n', 'different types of data before we dive into database\\n', 'management systems? Quick note, before even I dive into database\\n', 'management systems. Prior to DBMS, how\\n', 'was data organized. Pretty much file system\\n', 'was your only solution. You had files and then\\n', 'various file system, ways of organizing\\n', 'your data files using your directory hierarchy. That was pretty much how\\n', 'people used to organize data. Sounds very messy and very\\n', \"difficult for you to actually use the data for any analysis. You'll be able to do\\n\", \"some basic analysis. I've demonstrated that you over the course of like\\n\", \"3-4 lectures now, I've shown you so\\n\", 'many shell commands and docker commands\\n', 'that will enable you to just leverage the file system\\n', 'to do some basic analysis. Then people moved on to\\n', 'creating what is known as database management\\n', 'system. What is DBMS? Basically, DBMS is a software\\n', 'that enables you to create a systematic way to store retrieve and manage data\\n', 'for doing data analysis. The key part about database\\n', 'management systems is that they ensure a high\\n', 'level of consistency, integrity while\\n', \"offering security. Let's go over some key\\n\", \"features associated with DBMS software applications. You'll be able to store and retrieve your data in\\n\", 'an organized manner. The most typical example of storage organization is\\n', 'going to be table format, and you have other things\\n', \"like key value stores, object based storage, and so on. So that's the key feature. You'll be able to\\n\", 'consistently store and retrieve the data\\n', 'for your analysis. The next feature, database\\n', 'management systems offer data security, that is they restrict\\n', 'access to only folks who have authorized access to\\n', 'be able to access the data. You have your\\n', 'authentication mechanism for you to be able to access\\n', 'the data into any database. So basic level of security. Actually, DBMS also\\n', 'offers concurrency, being able to support\\n', 'multiple simultaneous users, not for just read, but for also\\n', \"simultaneous writes. That's a big thing. Both of us, being able to write into the\\n\", \"same table is a big deal. That's why DBMS has a\\n\", 'lot of significance. So the next key feature is\\n', 'going to be data integrity. While supporting\\n', 'concurrency, you always need to assure that your data is accurate and also consistent so as to not have\\n', 'different views across different uses\\n', 'of your data storage. And then finally,\\n', 'you have a means of setting up backup\\n', 'and recovery, which ensures data\\n', 'protection and restoration. These are some key\\n', \"high level features of database management systems. Let's move on to\\n\", 'talking about what exactly is meant by schema. I kept throwing around\\n', 'the term schema. Schema is nothing but an\\n', 'organizational blueprint, which will define exactly how your data storage is\\n', 'supposed to work. So key aspects of\\n', 'schema include, give me the structure\\n', 'and type definition associated with, for instance, a table\\n', 'or a key value store. How exactly should my\\n', \"data be structured? Also, give me the relationships. What are the primary keys? What are the foreign keys? We'll see definition for\\n\", 'those few slides from now. Also, what are the constraints\\n', 'associated with the data? Can I store just unique values associated with some field? Can I store null values? Can I have default values? Should something be\\n', 'always having data, that is, can I enforce some\\n', 'fields should be not null. So another feature with\\n', \"respect to schemas is that you're going to have\\n\", 'an option called as indexes. Indexing is the\\n', 'process of having various data structure\\n', 'implementations in order to enable you to perform fast searches and sorts on your data\\n', \"that is being stored. So, we'll not dive\\n\", \"deep into indexing. If you're really interested in learning more about indexing, then you should be\\n\", 'considering the 564 course, which actually is about\\n', 'designing a good database. So that is the right place for you to be able to\\n', 'learn more about indexing. Now, another aspect\\n', 'about schema is that it offers us to have\\n', \"a higher level view with only a subset of data for anyone who doesn't\\n\", 'actually need to be involved in the other specific\\n', 'details as to like how exactly data is stored on the underlying physical\\n', 'or virtual machine. You also have\\n', 'associated procedures like stored procedures, predefined SQL\\n', 'queries, for example, would be a stored procedures, which can be used to take\\n', 'a snapshot of your data and provide that\\n', \"to the user who's interested only in that\\n\", 'particular snapshot. Any questions about the\\n', 'definition of schema before we learn about\\n', 'three different types of abstractions for schema. This is not supposed to\\n', \"be here. I'll delete. That's fine, my apologies. That was before I\\n\", \"formatted the slide. Let's learn about\\n\", 'three different levels of abstraction for schema. First of all, in the\\n', 'bottom over here, you have your disk device\\n', \"where you'll actually be storing your data in\\n\", 'some form of the other. On top of that, the\\n', 'very first layer is going to be something\\n', 'called a physical schema. Associated with physical schema, you have painstaking\\n', 'level of details, like, what exactly is the\\n', 'data storage mechanism. How do you organize the files\\n', 'within your data storage? How are you doing indexing, all the associated details\\n', 'that anyone who is trying to maintain and manage the entire data storage\\n', \"system will want to know. Basically all of the details, and administrator who's running that particular data storage\\n\", \"they'll want to know. The next level is something\\n\", 'called a conceptual schema, otherwise known as\\n', 'logical schema. This describes what people typically refer\\n', \"to as data model. It's going to give you a slightly higher\\n\", 'level logical view or conceptual view associated\\n', \"with your data storage. We'll see an example of\\n\", 'both physical and concept, not physical schema\\n', 'conceptual schema shortly. And then the topmost level, you have external schema, which is often the type\\n', 'of schema abstraction, which is visible to\\n', 'application programs. These are also referred\\n', 'to as conceptual schema, describes your data storage\\n', 'at a very high level design. What are all the tables? How are the tables\\n', \"associated with each other? Pretty much that's it. That's all the detail\\n\", \"that you're going to get. Any questions on three\\n\", 'different levels of abstraction of schema before we move on to learning\\n', 'about various types for database management\\n', 'systems? Question. >> [inaudible]. >> That would be definitely associated with either\\n', 'the logical level or the physical level. The actual data itself can\\n', 'be thought of as like, associated with the abstraction\\n', 'of the logical level, but the actual data storage will definitely be\\n', \"physical schema. So at the logical level, you're not going to care\\n\", 'about how is my file organized within my\\n', 'database, for example. So types of database\\n', 'management systems. I think the first one\\n', 'is going to be the one that all of you can\\n', 'most relate to? There are actually\\n', 'many different types of database management systems, not specifically just\\n', 'RDBMS and NoSQL. First option, relational\\n', 'database management system, otherwise known as RDBMS, the most famous way\\n', 'of storing your data. Your data is going\\n', 'to be stored within tables with predefined schema, specific structures,\\n', 'what are all the tables? What are all the columns\\n', 'within each table? And what are all the data types that can be stored within\\n', 'each of those columns. All of those will be\\n', 'exactly defined for you. The use case scenario\\n', 'is for us to use RDBMS for transactional\\n', 'based systems. Any systems that have\\n', 'row based operations are typically referred to as\\n', \"transactional based systems. A couple of slides from now, we'll learn the difference\\n\", \"between OLAP and OLTP. I'll repeat this there as well. Examples of typical RDBMS include like open\\n\", 'source versions like MySQL, PostgreSQL. And then you also have\\n', 'proprietary versions like Oracle, Microsoft, and so on. Depends on your\\n', \"use case scenario. If you have a smaller company, you'll probably want to go\\n\", 'with an open source version as opposed to going with a proprietary version\\n', 'where you have to pay for the solution. Project P2 is going\\n', \"to focus on MySQL. Starting with Monday lecture, we'll focus our topics\\n\", 'on MySQL and how to write SQL queries to solve various data\\n', \"analysis questions. Let's move on to the\\n\", 'second type of DBMS, which is NoSQL DBMS. The data storage has four\\n', 'different categories with respect to NoSQL database\\n', 'management systems. First one being key value store, as one would guess, your data will be organized\\n', 'by associating keys with it, hence the name key value store. Example of key value store, NoSQL DBMS, include\\n', 'Redis, DynamoDB. Then you have the\\n', 'second category, which is document store. Your data is stored in the\\n', 'form of document objects. So examples for\\n', 'document store base, NoSQL databases include\\n', 'MongoDB and CouchDB. After we spend about 3 or\\n', \"3.5 lectures on MySQL, we're going to move on to\\n\", 'learning about MongoDB and how to use NoSQL databases. Third category of NoSQL\\n', 'database management systems, column family store,\\n', 'column based storage. Typically, when you\\n', 'think of data storage, all of us will think\\n', \"of row based storage. That's what all of us\\n\", 'are very familiar with. You have data storage\\n', 'techniques which focus on column orientation instead\\n', 'of raw orientation. Example of that\\n', 'would be Cassandra, which is another NoSQL\\n', 'database management system. Fourth category,\\n', 'graph databases. Your data is going to be\\n', 'stored in the form of nodes, and then relationships will be stored in the form of edges. An example of that would\\n', 'be Neo4j implementation. The use case for NoSQL\\n', 'database management is going to be for\\n', 'big data analysis, some real time application\\n', \"that you're trying to develop. Any questions on either of these types of database\\n\", \"management systems? Let's learn a few more. The main focus for the next\\n\", 'two or three weeks will be on RDBMS and NoSQL DBMS. But I want to introduce\\n', 'other types as well. You have something called Object-Oriented database\\n', 'management system, OODBMS. The data storage is going to\\n', 'be in the form of objects. Both your data and behavior will be stored using\\n', \"object format. Just give me 30 more seconds. We'll wrap up this slide\\n\", 'so that we can continue next lecture at the\\n', 'beginning of the next slide. Use case scenario for\\n', 'object oriented DBMS, complex data models, multimedia\\n', \"applications, and so on. Graph DBMS, it's going to again store the data\\n\", 'in the form of graphs. Graph DBMS is slightly\\n', 'different from graph implementation\\n', \"of NoSQL DBMS. You'll again use graph DBMS for use case scenarios\\n\", 'like social networks, recommendation\\n', 'engines, and so on. Then you have In-Memory\\n', 'database management system, where your data,\\n', 'instead of being stored in disc will\\n', 'be stored in RAM. This is typically used\\n', 'for things like gaming, where high speed\\n', 'is a requirement and also high frequency\\n', \"trading, and so on. Let's go ahead and wrap\\n\", \"up the lecture here. We'll continue this slide deck at the beginning of\\n\", 'the next lecture. Have a good weekend, everyone.']\n",
            "['>> [NOISE] Good\\n', 'afternoon, everyone. Can everybody in the back\\n', 'hear me well enough? Also, is the microphone volume sounding okay? Is it too loud? If that ever happens, please raise your\\n', \"hand and let me know. I most definitely don't want any of you to end\\n\", \"up with a headache. Let's wrap up the docker demo before diving into\\n\", 'the new topic. Last lecture, we learned a\\n', 'bunch of docker commands, so including docker Run. Recall that we use the docker\\n', 'pool command to pull the pN 224.04 image from\\n', 'the Docker hub, and you can run a new program in a new container using\\n', 'the Docker Run command. Specifically, if you\\n', \"want to run bash, which is an interactive program, you're going to have\\n\", \"to use the I-T flags, that's I for interactive, dash T for terminal. And then you're going to have to mention the name of the image, which is Obuntu, in this case, and the name of the program, which is going to be Bash. So this will now take you into the launch docker\\n\", 'container inside which you can execute\\n', 'any of the commands. Recall that inside\\n', \"your Docker container, you're always going\\n\", 'to be the root. You can exit this\\n', 'session by either pressing Control D or by\\n', \"typing exit on your keyboard. Now, that's going to stop that particular docker container and create a still\\n\", 'docker container. So if you use the Docker PS-A\\n', 'command that will now list that particular still\\n', 'docker container as one of the things that\\n', 'you need to clean up. hopefully, all of you\\n', 'remember the couple of cleanup commands that we learned as part of\\n', 'the previous lecture. You can combine Docker PS-AQ, which is the quiet output bar, and that will only give\\n', 'you the container ID. You can combine that with the docker remove command to remove all of the se containers. So I can simply say docker rm, and then within a couple\\n', 'of vertex, docker ps -aq. So if I go back to executing\\n', \"docker ps -A command, I shouldn't be able to see any container still\\n\", 'containers now. We also learned about\\n', \"the docker RMI command, which enables you to remove images that you're not\\n\", 'going to be using. Please make sure to use all of those cleanup commands often through the course\\n', 'of the semester. So, one other example that I want to go\\n', 'through with respect to docker run command is\\n', 'to show you how to run a container or launch a container\\n', 'using detached mode. Let me go ahead and\\n', 'clear my screen. Before I show you\\n', \"the detached mode, let's just run a regular\\n\", 'docker run command. I am going to be running a\\n', 'really small shell script. First of all, I need to mention the image name, which is Ubuntu. The name of the program,\\n', \"which is going to be SH. Let's use SH instead of bash. And I'm going to run a\\n\", 'simple shell program, which is going to echo\\n', \"hello and then sleep for, let's say three seconds, and then echo by. You're going to have to mention a the program that you want to run within double quotations. And then in order to be able to run this as a shell command, you're going to have to use\\n\", 'the -C flag for the SH shell. So SH -C and then within\\n', 'double quotations, you can mention any number of shell commands separated\\n', 'by semi colon. So this is now going\\n', 'to dump to the screen. Hello, sleep for three\\n', 'seconds, and then print by. What if I wanted to change the sleep from three\\n', \"seconds to 300 seconds? I'm not going to\\n\", 'presenter for now, but I want to run this simple program using detached mode so that\\n', 'you can see how you can interact with a\\n', \"container that's running either a slow program or a program that's going\\n\", 'to run for a long term. So detached mode is going to\\n', \"be represented by the flag hyphen D. You're\\n\", 'going to have to say docker run hyphen D\\n', \"name of the image, and then followed by which you're going\\n\", 'to have to mention, whatever program you want that particular\\n', 'container to run? So if I press enter now, my terminal session will not be occupied by the\\n', \"docker container. That's because we're running\\n\", 'docker in detached mode. So if you go to\\n', \"Docker PS Hyphen A, you'll be able to see\\n\", 'a couple of things, the container that exited\\n', 'a few seconds ago, the one which we used to run the sleep three seconds\\n', 'version of the program. And then another one, which is currently running. For the slow program\\n', \"with sleep 300 seconds. So we're going to\\n\", 'use this scenario to learn a couple of\\n', 'more docker commands, which are helpful for you\\n', 'to take a look at logs associated with an existing\\n']\n",
            "['perform equality check, or if you want a\\n', 'specific condition to be applied, for example, a regular expression,\\n', 'you need to enclose the value within another\\n', 'inner dictionary. And the key within\\n', 'the dictionary should be the operator,\\n', 'which is $regex. All operators in MongoDB are specified using dollar\\n', \"followed by operator name.

So I need to match\\n', 'any business name that either directly\\n', 'ends with inc, the symbol that you use for mentioning ending with\\n', 'something in regex is dollar. Again, let me repeat what I mentioned closer to the end\\n', 'of the previous lecture. I will not be covering\\n', 'regular expression in detail, but I do expect you to know the basics of all the regular\\n', 'expression operators. If your background is from 320, hopefully all of you remember the regular expression lecture\\n', 'content that we covered.

Instead of using:3, that will retrieve\\n\", 'the first three, and then if you\\n', 'say -3: that will return the last three entries. Any questions at all\\n', \"on the regex operator? Let's move on temporarily from find method to learn about\\n\", 'a couple of other methods. The first one that\\n', 'I want to talk about is findOne method. So if you look up the\\n', 'MongoDB documentation, let me actually briefly\\n', 'open this link. All of the method names\\n', 'will have camel cases. Hopefully all of you by now are familiar with what\\n', 'is camel case. You capitalize the first letter of second or any\\n', 'subsequent words that forms that\\n', 'particular phrase.

That is if you try to invoke\\n', \"findOne with camel case, that will not work with PyMongo. So you'll have to mention\\n\", 'the API call name as find_one instead of\\n', \"findOne with CamelCase. Hopefully, that's\\n\", \"clear to everyone. Let's talk about what exactly findOne will\\n\", 'enable you to do. Recall that find method enables\\n', 'you to create a cursor, which will enable you to\\n', 'iterate through all of the matching documents\\n', 'based on the criteria that you mentioned within\\n', 'your query and projection. findOne, on the other hand, it simply fetches the\\n', 'very first document in your collection that\\n', 'matches a specific query. You could mention a query as well to do filtering to\\n', 'a specific condition. But it will only\\n', \"retrieve one document. Unlike find, findOne directly returns the document to you because it's a\\n\", \"single document, you don't really\\n\", 'need an iterator to iterate over that\\n', 'particular document. For instance, if you want to be able to find the\\n', 'very first strip, you can do two things. You can either say find() and invoke the limit\\n', 'method on the result, which will give you a cursor. Recall that find always\\n', \"gives you a cursor. That's sometimes\\n\", \"annoying when you just won't explore one\\n\", 'of the documents. Instead of using find, you can find_one API method, which will enable\\n', 'you to retrieve the very first document. directly as a dictionary\\n', 'object instance, corresponding to whatever\\n', 'type the document has inside the dictionary\\n', 'object instance. Any questions on\\n', \"find versus findOne? So we've already covered how\\n\", 'to access MongoDB shell. Again, very useful for you to do some initial\\n', 'exploration on any collection that\\n', 'you want to get familiarized to before you\\n', 'actually start writing code, because it has\\n', 'syntax highlighting. It makes it very\\n', 'easy for you to read the document structure\\n', 'overall as opposed to reading it inside your\\n', \"Jupiter notebook session. Now, let's move on to\\n\", \"the next API function, which is count documents. As the name suggests, it's going to return an integer for the number of documents that match the query that you pass as the very\\n\", \"first argument here. Let's solve the\\n\", 'first question here, which is asking how many trips are in the trips collection. First of all, the\\n', 'collection name is trips, and then the API method\\n', \"name is count_documents. I don't really have\\n\", 'any query here. I need to be able to just find all of the trips\\n', \"in the collection, so I don't have to specify\\n\", 'any argument at all here. I need to specify an empty\\n', 'query, my apologies. Unlike find, this expects you to mention an empty query\\n', 'dictionary object instance, difference between find and\\n', 'count_documents method. So this just gives you the total number of trips\\n', \"within the trips collection. Now, here's another question, which will ask you\\n\", 'to write a query instead of just counting all of the documents\\n', 'within the trips. How many trips were\\n', 'taken by people born after the year 1988. Let me go ahead and start typing the solution, count_documents. And the very first argument\\n', 'needs to be the query here. The query needs to mention\\n', \"the name of the field. I'm just going to directly\\n\", 'look up the name of the field from my notes here. As opposed to doing that\\n', 'you can always explore the very first document to\\n', 'find the name of the field. The name of the\\n', 'field is birth year, and followed by which I need\\n', 'to mention some value here. Here, I need to be able\\n', 'to apply a conditional. Hopefully, all of you remember the comparison operators that we discussed during\\n', 'last lecture.

So 1,251 trips among the 10,000 trips were taken by people born after the year 1988. Any questions so\\n', 'far before we move on to a slightly more\\n', \"complex collection? That might be an understatement. It's actually relatively\\n\", 'much more complex when compared to the trips in the\\n', 'inspections collections, which had relatively\\n', \"smaller size documents. I've given you the link again to all of the\\n\", 'sample datasets. Feel free to explore other\\n', 'datasets that you find of interest from the\\n', 'MongoDB documents page. So, first of all,\\n', \"very first step. I'm talking about a\\n\", 'new database here, which means that I\\n', 'need to make sure to create a new database\\n', \"object instance reference. So recall the syntax for this, the client object instance, which enables you to retrieve the MongoDB client connection, followed by which you're\\n\", 'going to mention dot, and then the name\\n', 'of the database. This is equivalent to the use statement that\\n', \"you'd use inside MongoSH. Of course, to be able to\\n\", 'use a particular database, you need to first have\\n', \"created the database. I haven't quite\\n\", 'given you the create a query MongoDB query\\n', 'on the Mongo shell. Feel free to look that\\n', \"if you're interested. So this enables you\\n\", 'to create or do a lazy creation of a new\\n', \"database called sample_airbnb. I'm specifically using\\n\", \"the same variable DB because we're not\\n\", \"going to go back to sample_training database for the rest of today's\\n\", \"lecture [inaudible]. So I'm making sure to\\n\", 'replace the object instance. I have already populated the sample_airbnb\\n', 'dataset database with collections in\\n', \"my Docker Container. If you're following\\n\", \"along with the lecture, you'll probably want to run\\n\", \"the next two cells over here. Just a quick overview, I've created directories\\n\", \"to represent each of the datasets that we'll be covering during\\n\", \"today's lecture. So sample_airbnb\\n\", 'directory contains a JSON file,\\n', \"listingsAndReviews.JSON. That's what your code over here will populate [inaudible] if you run the up of two cells as you can see. I already have my listings and reviews\\n\", 'collection populated. So the very first\\n', \"thing that you'd probably always want\\n\", \"to do when you're working with a brand new\\n\", 'collection is to make sure that you take a look\\n', \"at the very first document. So I'm going to just\\n\", 'copy paste the name of the collection so as\\n', 'to not make a typo here, find_one method is the one\\n', \"that I'm looking for here. So that gives you a single\\n\", 'document which specifies the airbnb listing and associated whatever information\\n', \"that you have over here. Let's go over a\\n\", 'couple of things. So first of all, you have\\n', 'a huge document here. You have the listing\\n', 'details itself, which are covered as field value pairs within the\\n', 'original dictionary. You have things like how many nights you are allowed to stay, how many bedrooms does the\\n', \"listing have and so on. And then you have, amenities, which is going to be an array inside the original document. So you're going to have to learn how to use\\n\", 'array operators to process the content inside\\n', 'the amenities array here. And then if you scroll\\n', 'down a little bit, you have things like, what are all the reviews? Notice that the review\\n', 'is going to be a list of more documents that you have within the original\\n', 'document over here? Hopefully, the\\n', \"structure is clear. Let's do a top hat question\\n\", 'based on this structure. And I want all of\\n', 'you to take time to discuss this TopHat question\\n', \"with your neighbor. So let's go ahead and do this. What relationship do you see between the Airbnb\\n\", 'listings and reviews? Again, please discuss\\n', 'the question. Please make sure to submit your response if you\\n', \"haven't already done so. >> [inaudible]. >> Challenging\\n\", 'question for sure. I was thinking there will be\\n', 'a lot of split votes here. Embedded is the correct answer. Why is embedded the\\n', 'correct answer here? Very simple explanation. Somebody volunteer and tell me why embedded is the\\n', \"correct answer here. How many collections are there? >> Because it doesn't\\n\", 'show a relationship. >> Both of them enable you\\n', 'to show a relationship, both link and embedded enable\\n', 'you to show a relationship. How many collections are\\n', 'there within the database? One. Clearly it cannot be a linked relationship\\n', 'because there are no other collections for you to actually specify the\\n', 'linked relationship. Definition of embedded\\n', 'versus linked relationship. Whenever you just take the associated\\n', 'detailed information and put it as a field value pair within the original\\n', 'document itself, you have an embedded\\n', 'relationship. Your original document is probably going to be\\n', 'about the Airbnb listing. Why just dump all the reviews into the listing document itself and make it\\n', 'super cluttered. So this is an example of having\\n', 'everything in one place, which would make analysis and readability a\\n', \"little bit challenging. Later during the lecture, we'll see an example dataset where you have,\\n\", 'linked relationship, instead of embedded\\n', 'relationship, and how that makes\\n', 'a huge difference with respect to\\n', 'readability and analysis. Any questions at all about\\n', \"linked versus embedded? I'm going to comment this out so that it doesn't annoy me. So last lecture,\\n\", 'we learned about the OR logical operator and also how AND is the\\n', 'default logical operator. I wanted to just go through simple examples to cover\\n', 'all four logical operators. And throughout the rest of\\n', \"the lecture, you'll have, documentation and\\n\", 'description corresponding to various MongoDB operators. As I mentioned, all operators\\n', 'need to be specified using dollar symbol followed\\n', \"by which you'll have some form of term\\n\", \"describing the operator. Let's go through some\\n\", 'questions to just solidify our understanding\\n', \"of the logical operators. First of all, let's\\n\", 'solve this question, which is asking you to find the listings where the price is 100 and the number\\n', 'of bedrooms is two. So let me specify\\n', 'my query over here, which is going to have\\n', 'two associated fields. The price field, which is 100, and then I want to be able to specify\\n', 'the number of bedrooms, which comes from\\n', 'the bedrooms field, which needs to be two. Let me actually make this\\n', \"dictionary go on a single line. That's my query. So let me just retrieve only the relevant\\n\", \"field information. I'm going to only retrieve\\n\", 'the name of the listing, so I need to say \"name\": 1. And then I\\'m interested\\n', 'in the price obviously, so I\\'ll also say \"price\": 1. Let me also retrieve bedrooms\\n', 'by saying \"bedroom\":1. Hopefully, all of you remember\\n', 'from last lecture that every document is associated\\n', 'with a unique ID, which is called\\n', 'as the object ID, which is stored\\n', 'within the field_ID. Understand until I really need to access an object\\n', \"with its unique ID. I'm always going to just ignore this ID and not really use it. This will come in handy when you need to combine documents so that are split across multiple collections that\\n\", \"have a linked relationship. For now, I don't need it, so I'm just going to go ahead\\n\", \"and run the query as such. So I'm using a list slicing to display the top\\n\", 'five results over here, where I have the pricing\\n', 'to be exactly 100 and the number of bedrooms\\n', 'to be two bedrooms. So I implicitly use the AND logical\\n', 'operator here because I did not explicitly\\n', 'mention it anywhere. The default logical operator\\n', 'that gets applied in between your fields specified within your query argument is always going to be\\n', 'the AND operator. You can make things\\n', 'simpler by explicitly mentioning that you are\\n', 'applying the AND operator. If you want to do that, instead of just specifying the query as a dictionary here, your dictionary should have\\n', 'the operator as the key, which in this case, is going\\n', 'to be the AND operator. So because AND needs\\n', 'to be applied in between multiple\\n', 'field conditions, the value corresponding to both AND and OR operator\\n', \"will always be a list. And then within the list, you're going to have, as items, individual dictionaries\\n\", 'which have the key value pair\\n', 'for the condition. So I just need to make sure\\n', \"to make that conversion here, so as to explicitly mention that I'm using\\n\", 'the AND operator. Both of these queries\\n', 'are equivalent, and feel free to use\\n', 'whichever you prefer, but you should be\\n', 'able to identify that they both are equal length. Any questions on explicitly or implicitly specifying\\n', \"the AND operator? Now, for the next few questions, we're going to be dealing\\n\", \"with similar question set up, so I'm just going to copy paste my query from Q5 to answer Q6, which is asking, find\\n\", 'listings where the price is 100 or the number\\n', 'of bedrooms is two. We answered the\\n', 'question using AND, to answer the question using OR, you simply replace\\n', \"the logical operator, AND with OR here, and you'll either have the\\n\", 'listing have two bedrooms or the pricing of $100 here. Now, Q7, find the listings where price is not greater than 100. I want to be able to demonstrate\\n', \"the NOT operator here, so I'm going to specifically use a roundabout weight for\\n\", \"solving this question. There is a better way to do it. I'll show you that also shortly. First of all, I need to\\n\", 'specify my query here. So in order to mention\\n', 'the NOT operator, you first need to mention\\n', 'the name of the field. Notice that there is\\n', 'difference in terms of how exactly these\\n', 'operator syntax works, because for OR, you need\\n', 'to specify OR and AND, you need to specify\\n', 'the operator first, which is OR or AND, and then the value\\n', 'needs to be a list of all the conditions that\\n', 'you need to apply, so that you can apply the OR condition between\\n', 'those conditions. As opposed to that,\\n', \"when you have a NOT, you're going to\\n\", 'specify the name of the field first, which is price. And then within the value, you need to have a dictionary. Within that, your key is\\n', 'going to be the operator, which is the NOT operator, and the value is going\\n', 'to be the value that you want to apply\\n', 'for the NOT here, which is, you want\\n', 'to be able to find all the listings where the\\n', 'price is not greater than 100. So clearly, you need\\n', 'another dictionary here, and the innermost operator\\n', 'is going to be GT, and then the value is\\n', \"going to be 100 over here. I'm going to scroll\\n\", 'up and copy paste the same fields from before and get rid of the bedroom so that we have the\\n', \"relevant information. What am I missing? I'm missing a comma. There should be a\\n\", 'comma in between your query and your projection. So that gives you\\n', 'all of the listings where the price is\\n', 'not greater than 100. Just to demonstrate\\n', 'the NOT operator, I went about doing the solution, using a roundabout\\n', 'situation here. Of course, very easily, you can use the\\n', 'less than or equal to operator and not all use the NOT operator to solve this exact same question.\\n', 'How do you do that? Let me copy this the solution\\n', 'from the previous one. Instead of mentioning\\n', 'the NOT operator, you can simply get rid of that second level\\n', 'of inner dictionary and simply say the operator here is less than\\n', 'or equal to 100, which should do the\\n', \"exact same thing, but it's up to you to prefer\\n\", 'one operator over the other. Last logical operator. Find the listings where the\\n', 'price is neither 100 nor 200. Clearly, you need the\\n', \"NOR operator here. For the NOR operator, we're going to go back\\n\", 'to the OR and syntax. Instead of mentioning the\\n', \"name of the field first, you're going to have to\\n\", 'mention the NOR operator. And then argument\\n', 'to the NOR operator needs to be a list\\n', 'object instance. And within that list\\n', \"object instance, you're going to specify all of the conditions that need to\\n\", 'be separated by the NOR. So let me actually make my\\n', 'list as an empty list here. So I have my empty list. Within that, I need to separate my conditions using commas. And then each\\n', 'condition needs to be mentioned as a dictionary\\n', 'object instance. And that would be price being 100 and then price\\n', 'being 200 here. Retrieve all the listings\\n', 'where the price is neither 100 nor 200. Any questions about the\\n', 'four logical operators? Hopefully, it should\\n', \"be straightforward. Let's move on to the next\\n\", 'category of operators, which are element\\n', 'query operators. And element query\\n', 'operators can either be applied to the original\\n', 'documents fields, or it could be applied to\\n', 'the fields within any of the sub documents or the embedded documents that you have within the\\n', \"original document. Let's cover two different MongoDB element query operators, which are exists, and you're going to be using\\n\", 'Boolean values of true or false with exists to check whether some field\\n', 'exists or not. And type enables you to select documents that have\\n', 'a specified type. Why is type of significance? Remember that, in non\\n', \"relational databases, you don't have type\\n\", 'enforcements, which means that, technically, you\\n', 'could have one field, have two different\\n', 'types of data stored within two different documents within the same collection. So type is going to come in handy in case you want to only process documents that have\\n', \"a specific defined type. So let's just do the exists\\n\", 'operator, using question Q9. Find listings where\\n', \"cleaning field exists. So I specifically chose a field, which doesn't exist within all the documents in order to demonstrate the\\n\", 'exists operator here. So let me specify my query and my\\n', 'projection for my query. My field name is going\\n', 'to be cleaning_fee. To make your life easier, I just literally\\n', 'listed the field name. As we all saw, the\\n', 'Airbnb document is huge and not so easy to read, even for you to get\\n', 'all the field names. The field name here is\\n', 'going to be cleaning fee, and the value needs to be within a dictionary because you want to apply a specific operator. Whenever you want to\\n', 'apply an operator, the value will always\\n', 'be a dictionary. The operator here is going to be the exists operator\\n', 'and the value corresponding to\\n', 'that key needs to be either the Boolean value true\\n', \"or the Boolean value false. Let's find all the\\n\", 'listings where the cleaning fee\\n', \"field first exists, and then I'll show\\n\", 'you the opposite of the adjacent false. So as part of the projection, let me retrieve the\\n', \"name of the listing, and also the cleaning fee, which is what we're applying\\n\", 'our query based on, and let me filter out\\n', 'the ID fields over here. So you have 4,024 Airbnb listings that have some form of cleaning\\n', \"fee associated with it. I'm not sure about\\n\", 'all of you guys. I used to be a huge Airbnb fan when they did not have\\n', 'hidden cleaning fees. And then, the pandemic happened, and they always sprung this\\n', 'unusually high fee on you. It made me wonder whether\\n', 'they were actually cleaning that well for you to be able\\n', 'to spend that much money. Anyway, I used to love chatting with all\\n', 'the Airbnb hosts, and I had really good experience across multiple countries\\n', \"staying at various Airbnbs. I don't do that anymore\\n\", \"because it's exorbitantly expensive to stay at\\n\", 'an Airbnb nowadays, as opposed to\\n', \"staying at a hotel. Hopefully, at some point, they'll make it go away. Maybe. So cleaning fee, what if you want to\\n\", \"find the listings that don't have the fee? Let me change the true to false, and that should give us the\\n\", \"total number of listings. The remaining listings of 1,531, Airbnb listings don't\\n\", 'have a cleaning fee. Definitely my favorite\\n', 'part of the data set. Any questions about\\n', \"exists operator? Let's move on to\\n\", \"the type operator. So I've given you a\\n\", 'documentation link over here, which lists all of the types. I do not expect you to\\n', 'memorize this stable. Let me make it quite clear. Neither do I expect you\\n', 'to write down all of these types in your note\\n', 'sheet for the exam. If there is going\\n', 'to be a question that will involve\\n', 'the type operator, I will make sure all\\n', 'of the answers have the exact same types so\\n', \"that you don't have to think about what type exactly is applicable to\\n\", 'that particular field. But this link will be handy\\n', 'if you want to explore the supported types inside the MongoDB database.\\n', \"So that's it. Let me go back to my\\n\", 'template notebook file. Find the listings where the\\n', \"price is stored as a decimal. Let's start typing the query, price needs to be the\\n\", 'name of the field. And the value needs to be a dictionary because we want\\n', 'to apply the type operator, and the value corresponding to the inner dictionary which\\n', 'has type operator as the key, needs to be the type itself. So going back to here, I will be using the aliases\\n', 'for representing the type. I know that the price field\\n', \"has type Decimal 128. So I'm directly\\n\", 'going to show you the result by\\n', 'specifying decimal, which is the alias\\n', \"for Decimal 128. And then, once again let's only retrieve some fields\\n\", \"instead of all the fields. So I'm going to retrieve\\n\", \"the name, the price, which is of significance, and then let's make sure not to retrieve\\n\", 'the ID fields as well. I specifically have\\n', 'the len function on the list of the retrieve\\n', 'documents so as to, show you that all of\\n', 'the documents have the price stored as a\\n', 'decimal value here. One sure would hope\\n', \"that there would not be a listing where you don't have the price field\\n\", 'type unless somebody wants to literally\\n', \"give us a free APNV, which I won't complain about. Any questions about\\n\", 'type operator or either of the element\\n', 'query operators. So quick note. Both the exists and the type\\n', 'operator can be used on, any of the embedded collection, embedded documents within\\n', 'the same document as well. So I think I have one such\\n', \"example where we'll be covering an array operator\\n\", \"using the exists operator. We'll come back to that when we reach the array operators. Now, next category of operators, evaluation\\n\", \"query operators. I haven't listed all of the\\n\", 'evaluation query operators, because some of them at this point are not\\n', 'significant to us. There is one called JSON schema, which will enable you to enforce schema to\\n', 'your documents. You can use that operator to verify that all\\n', 'of your documents have been following the\\n', \"JSON schema structure that you have defined. So we've already covered\\n\", 'the Regex operator, which is part of the\\n', \"evaluation query operator. I'm not going to talk about\\n\", \"the Regex operator again. We're going to learn about that, the other two operators\\n\", 'that are listed here, which are expression operator, EXPR in short, and modulo\\n', 'operator, MOD in short. Expression allows you to specify aggregate expressions with a specific MongoDB\\n', \"query language. I'll clarify what\\n\", 'exactly that means. When we solve the question, it should be quite obvious. Then you want to be\\n', 'able to do comparison between two different fields\\n', 'within the same document, expression is going to\\n', 'come in very handy. Also if you want to apply complicated expressions\\n', 'like some value being greater than a\\n', \"equal to some other fields value and so on, that's when expression is\\n\", 'going to come in handy. Modulo operator as\\n', 'one would guess, performs the model operation. You have all possible\\n', \"mathematical operators, like add, multiply, and so on. I'll probably list a bunch of mathematical operators at the\\n\", \"beginning of next lecture. I don't have it in\\n\", \"today's lecture in notebook. Question 11. Find all the listings\\n\", 'where extra people is more than twice of the\\n', \"guest included the field. You'd also need the\\n\", 'multiply operator to be able to solve this question. So just give me one second. I want to make sure I have\\n', 'the right notes here. First of all, we need to\\n', 'apply the EXPR operator here. Let me start my query by mentioning that I\\n', 'need the EXPR operator. I need to be able to find\\n', 'all the listings where one field has more\\n', 'than twice the value of the other field. So I need to do comparison\\n', 'between two different fields. So whenever you have\\n', \"the EXPR operator, you're going to specify\\n\", 'the value as a dictionary. And whatever condition that\\n', 'you want to be able to apply here needs to go as the\\n', 'key within the dictionary, and the value corresponding\\n', 'to the condition needs to be a list of fields based on which you want\\n', 'to apply the condition. So I need greater\\n', 'than operator here, assuming that I\\n', 'want to do greater than operation or you could also do less than or equal to. Let me show you greater\\n', 'than solution for this. And I need to be able to apply that between two\\n', 'different fields. So clearly, I need to\\n', 'mention the two fields as list object instance here. So the very first\\n', 'field is going to be extra underscore people. I want all the listings\\n', 'where extra people is more than twice\\n', 'of guest included. So if I just want to apply\\n', 'the greater than operator, I can simply say,\\n', 'guests_included here, that will retrieve all of\\n', 'the listings where you have extra people field having higher value than the\\n', \"guests included field. But that's not what the\\n\", \"question is asking. It's asking you to find\\n\", 'all of the listings where extra people is more than\\n', 'twice of the guest included. So which means that you have\\n', 'an additional condition to impose on the second field here, so you need to specify\\n', 'that condition within another dictionary\\n', 'object instance inside my list. It may actually make the\\n', 'second entry into a new line. So the guest included field is going to be subject to\\n', 'the multiply operator. Multiply operator needs to be mentioned before the field name, so I need to mention dollar multiply before\\n', 'the field name, and the value corresponding\\n', 'to that is going to be whatever field\\n', 'I want to multiply. And whatever factor\\n', 'that I want to multiply the field value by. Clearly, I have two values\\n', 'here, the field value, and whatever scalar\\n', \"that you want to multiply that field with, or you'll have two different\\n\", 'field values depending on what kind of multiplication\\n', \"you're trying to do. Here, we are trying to multiply the field value with a scalar. So I need to mention the values corresponding to the multiply operator\\n\", 'within a list. The first one is going to be\\n', 'guests included field here. And the scalar here\\n', \"is going to be two. I'm not yet done\\n\", 'typing my query. You have one small catch with respect to the\\n', \"expression operator. Notice that so far, we've always been using\\n\", 'the field name directly inside our query\\n', 'dictionary keys. Unfortunately, for the\\n', \"expression operator, you're going to have to include a dollar sign in front\\n\", 'of your field name. This most definitely\\n', 'should be in your notes. This is an exception\\n', 'when it comes to, like, applying the operator to the\\n', 'MongoDB document fields. So all of the field\\n', 'names should have a dollar sign in front\\n', 'of the field name. Any questions on the query while I just like\\n', \"type the projection. So simple rule of dumb, whenever you're applying\\n\", 'any kind of query, whether you need a dictionary as the value or the\\n', 'list as the value. When you have two\\n', \"or three items, then you'll always need a list. When you always need to\\n\", \"specify a field name, followed by a value, you'll always have a dictionary or like an operator\\n\", 'name followed by whatever condition\\n', 'that you want to apply along with that\\n', 'particular operator. So let me retrieve the name field and the\\n', 'extra people field. And what else do we need? Guests included field. Let me copy paste that so\\n', \"as to not make a typo. Once again, I'm just\\n\", 'going to make sure to exclude the ID field here. That gives you at least the very first listing where\\n', 'extra people, which is 15 in this listing is more than twice the number\\n', 'of guests included. That was a complicated question. Any questions at all about any of the parts of the\\n', \"query that we wrote. Let's move to the next question, which will require you to\\n\", 'perform date manipulation. Find listings where\\n', \"the last review date is within the last 30 days. Clearly, we don't have data from the month of September of 2024 within our Airbnb collection. So because of that, For the purpose\\n\", \"of this question, let's assume that the current\\n\", 'day is March 11, 2019, which happens to be the last\\n', \"review fields latest date. Again, I've given you a\\n\", \"self assessment task here. Try to write code to find this information out because I wrote code to find that info. Although, I've just given you that info verbo\\n\", 'statement here. Clearly, I did not manually find what the last\\n', 'review date is. So First of all, I need to be able to calculate 30 days before March 11, 2019. In order to be able to do that, let me define a datetime\\n', 'object instance here. Just give me one\\n', 'minute. My notes align. My datetime object\\n', 'instance, hopefully, all of you remember that\\n', 'we imported datetime. So datetime expects you to mention the year as the very\\n', \"first positional argument, 2019, then followed by which you're going to\\n\", \"mention the month, followed by which you're\\n\", 'going to mention the date. And then you can optionally mention the time aspect as well, or you could leave\\n', \"that part out. It's totally up to you. So that will create a datetime object instance\\n\", 'for March 11, 2019. The type associated with the lost underscore review field is of date time\\n', \"object instance type, which is why we're creating a datetime object\\n\", 'instance type so as to perform the comparison here. Thirty days ago, how do you calculate 30 days ago\\n', 'from a specific date? You can use time Delta function, the datetime object\\n', 'instance itself, and then I need to\\n', \"subtract 30 days, so I'm going to time Delta, and then I'm going to\\n\", 'specify the argument to a name parameter\\n', \"base is 30 here. So that will give me 30 days ago datetime object instance. Now, with both of those, I'm going to combine both of that information with\\n\", 'the expression operator. In order to do that, I need\\n', 'to specify my query first. My query here is going to have the operator as the expression\\n', 'operator dollar EXPR, and the value corresponding to expression operator needs\\n', 'to be a dictionary. Within the dictionary, I specify my comparison operator,\\n', 'which in this case, is going to be greater than the 30 days ago\\n', \"calculation that we just did. So I'm going to simply say gt. And then what do I apply\\n\", 'the greater than to? That needs to be\\n', 'a list of things. So the first one needs to be the field name because we\\n', 'have expression operator, the field name needs to be dollar last underscore review instead of just last review. The other thing is going to be our time Delta that\\n', 'we calculated, which is like what is the\\n', 'datetime 30 days ago? Any last review that has date, which is greater\\n', 'than whatever date 30 days ago from March 11, 2019, I need to be able to\\n', 'retrieve such documents. And let me filter\\n', \"out the fields here. Let me actually copy paste from the previous question so as to not spend a lot of time here. So I'm just going to\\n\", 'eliminate extra people, change guests included\\n', 'to last review, and hopefully this should give\\n', 'us any Airbnb listing that has its last review 30 days\\n', 'before March 11, 2019. Any questions at all about\\n', \"the expression operator. We have a couple of minutes. Let's wrap up modular\\n\", 'operator real quickly. Find listings where price\\n', 'is a multiple of five. Let me just go ahead and\\n', 'directly type the query here. The operator that you need to apply is going to be\\n', \"the modular operator. And for the modular operator, you're going to have\\n\", \"syntax similar to not. You're going to mention\\n\", 'the field name first, followed by which\\n', \"you're going to mention the modulo operator. So the field name here\\n\", 'is going to be price.

Any questions about\\n', \"how to drop database? It'll come in handy\\n\", \"whenever you do [inaudible] restart and run-all. Let's go back to\\n\", 'our discussion on the topic of\\n', 'aggregation pipelines. Aggregation pipelines\\n', 'are definitely much more complicated than any of the questions that we have\\n', 'been answering so far. At this point I would\\n', \"like to remind all of you that MongoDB doesn't do a great job if your query\\n\", \"contains any form of typos, instead of giving you an error it's simply going to give\\n\", 'you an empty result. We all know the main\\n', 'reason for that is because MongoDB is supposed to be for semi structured data without\\n', 'strict schema enforcement. So the downside of not having strict schema\\n', 'enforcement is that MongoDB server cannot\\n', 'quite really say whether you have a typo or whether you actually\\n', 'meant to type that. So because of that, it is essential that you break\\n', 'down your pipeline stages and test each of them progressively as you\\n', \"develop your pipeline. And I'll show you\\n\", 'an example using the same questions that we solved at the end of\\n', 'the previous lecture. Hopefully, all of you remember the initial three stages\\n', 'that we discussed, match, which is very similar to the find\\n', \"method invocation.

Group stage is equivalent\\n\", 'to group by class in SQL. Enables you to group separate documents based on\\n', 'a specific grouping key.

Half of the times you'll\\n\", \"be using the dollar sign, half of the times you will not, and we'll cover examples\\n\", 'for both of those. First question that we\\n', 'are going to highlight is going to be from the last couple of questions at the end of the\\n', 'previous lecture. Find the average\\n', 'price rounded to two decimal places for all entire home apartment\\n', 'room type listings. Here is the actual solution. But before even we attempt to\\n', \"write the actual solution, I'm going to give all of you a really good\\n\", 'recommendation to start writing the match stage before even you start building\\n', 'your pipeline. If your pipeline is supposed\\n', 'to have a match stage, I strongly recommend that you write the equivalent\\n', 'find method call and verify the output of the\\n', 'find method call before even you actually start\\n', 'populating the pipeline. So in order to do that\\n', \"I'm going to go ahead and invoke find on my collection, listings and reviews\\n\", 'over here for the projection,\\n', \"parameters, argument. I'm selecting the\\n\", 'relevant field names, name, room type,\\n', \"and excluding ID. So let's talk about\\n\", 'the query here. For the query here,\\n', 'give me a second, I need to specify that I\\n', 'want a particular room type. And that particular\\n', 'room type is going to be entire home slash apartment. Once again, for any of these\\n', 'individual finer aspects, I would strongly\\n', 'recommend you to copy paste from the original data. Either from the question or\\n', 'from your exploration query, so as to make sure\\n', \"that you're not running into any issues. So this enables you to\\n\", 'verify the match stage. Once you have confirmed that your find method\\n', 'call actually works, what I would recommend\\n', 'is to literally copy paste this entire dictionary\\n', \"inside the match stage. So let's do a quick review of the pipeline\\n\", 'stages over here. So the pipeline itself is going to be\\n', 'surrounded by a list, and the stages are going to\\n', 'be entries within the list. Each entry is going to be a\\n', 'dictionary object instance. So you need to enclose that with an open curly braces\\n', 'closed curly braces, your key is going to be\\n', \"the name of the stage. In this case, that's going\\n\", 'to be the match stage. And the value is going to\\n', \"be another dictionary, the one that I just copied from the query parameter's argument to my find method\\n\", 'call over here. Any questions about\\n', 'how to verify the match stage before even\\n', \"you attempt the group stage? So, unfortunately there isn't any straightforward way for you to verify\\n\", 'the group stage, but to actually plug it\\n', 'into a pipeline and to use the aggregate method to run\\n', 'that particular pipeline. So the second stage in my pipeline is going\\n', \"to be the group stage. So in the group stage, you're going to have\\n\", 'to mention a couple of things within your\\n', 'inner dictionary. The first one is going to\\n', 'be the underscore ID field, which controls how exactly\\n', 'the grouping is done. I want to be able to compute average price for all\\n', \"entire home apartments. So I'm just going to group all the documents by specifying\\n\", 'none as the value here. And the computation here for the aggregate operation\\n', 'is going to be average. So here is going to be the rule of thumb\\n', 'for the group stage. Any new field that you create within the group stage\\n', 'does not have to be preceded with the\\n', 'dollar sign since average underscore price is a brand new field that\\n', \"you're trying to create, no dollar sign in front of it. But the computation for that, you need to be specifying\\n\", 'an existing field, which is going to\\n', 'be the price field. There you must use\\n', 'a dollar sign, so difference between no dollar versus dollar within the\\n', 'group stage over here. Any questions at all so far? Once you populate the second\\n', 'stage within the pipeline, I would definitely recommend\\n', \"you to run the pipeline up until that stage to confirm that you're actually getting\\n\", 'the correct answer. Of course, unless and\\n', \"until you're willing to write a bunch of additional code to actually\\n\", 'do this competition, which you can because json\\n', 'is very easy to process, sorry, Python dictionary\\n', \"is very easy to process. So I'm going to trust that this gives me the correct\\n\", 'answer at this point. If not, you can always\\n', 'write code to verify that. Now, on top of the stage, I need to be able to\\n', \"perform rounding. That's because always\\n\", 'your calculation is not going to be rounded\\n', 'off to two decimal digits, so which means that\\n', \"you need to be explicitly doing that step. For doing that step, we're going to be using\\n\", 'the project stage which is going to be the third entry\\n', 'within my pipeline list. Project is going to be\\n', 'the name of the stage. The value is going to be the\\n', \"corresponding dictionary. So in here you're going to\\n\", \"specify field value pairs, and you're going to specify\\n\", 'the name of the field, and the value is going\\n', 'to be whether or not you want to include that field\\n', 'zero or one, accordingly. So underscore ID field\\n', 'is going to be of no significance here because everything is going\\n', \"to have none, since we're grouping all\\n\", \"of the documents together. So I'm going to say, _id: 0. And then for the\\n\", 'actual computation, I need to be able to update\\n', \"my average price field. How do I want to update it by? Now, here's the difference. Once again, in project\\n\", \"stage as well, new fields don't\\n\", 'require a dollar sign. As opposed to that when\\n', \"you're referencing to an existing field to\\n\", 'do some manipulation, you must reference that\\n', 'using a dollar sign, hence the presence\\n', 'of the dollar sign on the calculation front and\\n', 'no presence of dollar sign. Even though the name of the\\n', \"field is exactly the same, you're technically trying\\n\", 'to create a new field, so no dollar sign here, and that should wrap\\n', 'up your pipeline. Any questions on how to write individual stages of the\\n', \"pipeline and test it? Now, let's move on to the next question\\n\", 'here, which is Q2. I did not get to type the\\n', \"solution for Q2 from scratch, so let's do this together. Find the average price of\\n\", 'all room_type listings. Previously, we were\\n', \"only interested in entire home apartments. As opposed to that, now I don't have a match stage\\n\", 'because I only want to do grouping based on unique\\n', 'values of the room type field. So the very first stage here is going to be\\n', 'the group stage. So let me go ahead and start\\n', 'typing the group stage here. The value is going to be my dictionary corresponding\\n', 'to the group stage. And for the ID field, now, I cannot mention none because\\n', 'I need to be able to group all individual unique\\n', 'values of the room underscore type field value together to create\\n', 'individual groupings. So which means that\\n', 'for the ID field, I need to mention the name of the existing field here\\n', \"instead of saying none, because we're referencing the\\n\", 'name of an existing field, I need to prepend that\\n', 'with a dollar sign, so I need to say $room_ type. And this is going to group based on room_ type field values. >> So that does the\\n', \"grouping for us. The average price calculation is exactly the same as before, so I'm just going to\\n\", 'copy paste that part of the group stage from\\n', 'the previous question. The only difference is\\n', \"we're now computing average price for every\\n\", \"single room type. So let's go ahead and execute the current version\\n\", 'of the pipeline. That should hopefully\\n', 'give you some level of confidence that your grouping\\n', 'is actually working. So you have three different\\n', 'types of room types, and then you have the average price corresponding\\n', \"to each of those. Once again, you should be able to now add on another stage, which is the project stage. It's exactly the same as\\n\", \"the previous question, we're just going to make\\n\", 'sure to round the number of decimal digits by two\\n', 'decimal digits here. Any questions at all\\n', \"about the examples that we've covered so far with the initial three\\n\", 'stages of the pipeline? Now, find the average price per bedroom for\\n', 'each property type. So clearly, you need to be able to group by two different\\n', 'things here together. Hopefully all of you remember\\n', 'how to do group by using two different SQL table columns. You just like specify whatever column you\\n', \"want to group by first as the first column name, and then followed by, which you'll say, and then\\n\", \"the second column name. You're going to have\\n\", 'something similar here but the syntax is going to\\n', \"be slightly different. So let's get started by\\n\", 'specifying the very first stage, which is going to be the\\n', \"group stage, once again. So I'm going to say\\n\", 'dollar group here, the value is going to be a dictionary and now\\n', \"here's your question. How do you actually specify\\n\", 'more than one field corresponding to the ID based on which you\\n', 'do the grouping? I wish this was\\n', 'consistent like the and, or operators, I wish like they would have made\\n', \"this into a list. Unfortunately, they haven't, you need to specify that\\n\", 'using a dictionary. This should be one of\\n', 'the exceptions that you should most definitely write\\n', 'down in your note shade, because there are\\n', \"exception cases when it comes to creating pipeline stages where you'd think that using a list\\n\", 'would be more intuitive, but unfortunately the syntax\\n', \"uses a dictionary instead. So because of this weird quirk, you're now going\\n\", 'to have to define key value pair within\\n', \"this dictionary, so your question is wait. I only have field names here. What's going to be the key?\\n\", \"What's going to be the value? Unfortunately, you're going to have to create a new field, which can have the exact\\n\", 'same as the old field, but that needs to be the key. For instance, the\\n', 'very first thing that I want to group by is\\n', \"going to be property type. Let's group by property\\n\", \"type first and then we'll group by bedrooms next. So I need to say my key is\\n\", 'property type and my value, as one would guess, is a field, so that should be dollar\\n', 'property underscore type. For all I know, this could\\n', \"be a different name, but I'm just making sure to retain the same name\\n\", 'because the field does have a logically\\n', 'well defined name, why would it change it. So this is going to be\\n', 'the first key value pair within the dictionary\\n', 'corresponding to my underscore ID field. The second key value\\n', 'pair is going to be the second field based on which I want to do the grouping. Once again, the field\\n', 'name is going to be for the new field name on\\n', 'the left of the colon sign. And then the field name on\\n', 'the right of the colon sign, the value is going to be\\n', 'the original field name, so you need to say\\n', 'dollar bedrooms here. And this is now going\\n', 'to perform group by property underscore\\n', \"type and bedrooms. Any questions so far? Again, to reiterate, you'd think that it is more intuitive to\\n\", 'have a list defined here. Unfortunately, MongoDB\\n', 'does not support that, it supports only a dictionary. So please write that\\n', 'down in your notes. And the average\\n', 'price calculation here is going to\\n', \"be very similar, so I'm just going to copy\\n\", 'paste from the previous cell. After I mention the ID field, I also need to mention the\\n', 'actual aggregate computation, which once again, is just\\n', 'going to be the average price. And let me just store that as AVG and the score\\n', \"price per bedroom. That's what I have in\\n\", \"my completed notes, so I'm just going\\n\", \"to go with that. So let's go ahead and\\n\", 'execute the cell. That gives us some output. That should give us some\\n', 'level of confidence that the group stage\\n', 'is actually working. You can go ahead and try a combination of that\\n', \"with the project stage. So I'm just going to add on one more stage\\n\", \"after the group stage, that's going to be\\n\", 'project over here. What do I want to\\n', 'be able to project, I want to be able\\n', 'to retain the ID because we are not grouping all of the\\n', 'documents together. So I need this\\n', 'particular information, what is the property\\n', 'type and what is the number of bedrooms corresponding to\\n', \"that. I need that. And the final thing that I'm\\n\", 'going to do is once again, round off the average\\n', 'price calculation to two decimal digits. I am going to copy base, so I to not waste\\n', 'our time typing the same thing over and over\\n', 'again for the rounding, excepting that I need to\\n', 'change variable names. So hopefully, that should\\n', 'give you the updated answer. Any questions on how to combine grouping based on\\n', \"two different field values? Now, let's combine\\n\", 'one group on top of another group stage\\n', 'by answering Q4, which builds upon Q3. Q4 is asking you to find the average price per bedroom\\n', \"for each property type, and we've already written\\n\", 'the query to solve that part of the question. It is then asking\\n', 'you to calculate total average price across\\n', 'all property types. That is like it is asking you\\n', 'to compute the average of all the averages\\n', 'that you computed using the first group\\n', \"stage over here. So I'm going to introduce a new group stage before\\n\", 'the project stage, let me go ahead and type that. For the ID part within\\n', 'the new group stage, I need to specify property type. And in order to access\\n', 'the property type, going back to the\\n', 'previous cells output, I need to access ID in here, which is a dictionary, and property type is a field\\n', 'within the inner dictionary. So to access that, I need to specify my syntax as dollar and underscore\\n', 'ID to indicate these IDs. And then from there, I need to specify property\\n', 'type this is MongoDB syntax, so it needs to be dot, so property underscore\\n', 'type from in there. Any questions on this\\n', 'particular syntax? I just want to make\\n', \"sure everybody's able to follow along with\\n\", \"this because we're applying grouping now on top\\n\", 'of an existing group stage. So dollar underscore ID, which is coming from the\\n', 'previous group stage, and then dot property\\n', 'underscore type, that will give you the grouping. So this is now going to group B by just property\\n', \"underscore type. That is like it's going\\n\", 'to compute the average of all the averages that you\\n', 'computed using stage 1, which happens to be\\n', 'the first group. Now, the average computation here is going to look similar. For instance, let\\n', 'me use the field as average price per property type, and I need to be able\\n', 'to compute average, so it needs to be a\\n', \"dictionary dollar AVG that's going to be my key. My value needs to be specified using a dollar\\n\", \"sign because we're referencing to an existing field created by the previous\\n\", 'stage of the group command. So in the existing\\n', 'field here is going to be average price per bedroom, so I need to say dollar, average price per bedroom here. And I just need to make sure to add a comma after the\\n', 'second group stage, and hopefully that should\\n', 'give us some calculation. Here is a problem, we\\n', 'see a bunch of nones. You got to be careful when\\n', 'you build your solution on top of some other\\n', 'question solution. The problem here\\n', 'is, as you can see, the project stage is using\\n', \"the wrong variable name, that's why you end up\\n\", 'with none as the value. That does not mean that your previous stages\\n', 'have an issue, I would just\\n', 'definitely recommend you to remove the\\n', 'project stage and confirm whether your\\n', 'second grouping actually yields\\n', \"the correct value. Here's the problem,\\n\", 'I need to make sure to round up the correct\\n', 'value type here, and that should give\\n', 'you the correct answer. Any questions on using two group stages\\n', \"within your query? Let's move on to\\n\", 'the next question, which is asking you to\\n', 'find the top two hosts who have the most listings. So first of all, I mentioned this previously, there may be listing document is definitely messy because, it contains a lot of\\n', 'embedded relationships. So which means that\\n', \"you'll probably need to do some exploration before even you can say what field is of\\n\", 'significance here. For instance, what\\n', \"I'm doing here is, I'm invoking the find method. Alternatively, you could\\n\", 'invoke find underscore one, retrieving single listing\\n', \"by applying limit of one. And then I'm just iterating\\n\", 'over every field within the listing and printing\\n', 'just the name of the field. And I would recommend\\n', 'going through this list and figuring out\\n', 'what field is of significance. Clearly, host is going to be of significance for us\\n', 'because we need to be able to find the top two\\n', \"hosts who have most listings. So I'm going to take the\\n\", \"exploration to the next stage, and I'm going to\\n\", \"check whether host is part of the field name. If so, I'm going to\\n\", 'go ahead and print the subfields within\\n', 'the host field, along with the values\\n', 'corresponding to the subfields. And this should give you\\n', \"all the necessary details that you're looking for. Host name, that's the information that\\n\", \"you're looking for here, so as to be able to\\n\", 'answer this question. Now, before we answer\\n', \"this question, let's learn about two\\n\", 'new pipeline stages, which are the sort\\n', 'and the limit stages. Sort enables you to reorder the documents based\\n', 'on a specified key. The syntax for sort\\n', 'is going to look very similar when compared to what we did previously for\\n', 'the sort method invocation. So sort stage actually\\n', 'expects you to list the name of the field\\n', 'without a dollar sign. Now sort is going to look very\\n', 'similar to the math stage. Mainly because sorting does not require manipulation\\n', 'of the value, it only requires you\\n', \"to reorder the data. That's the factor behind lack of dollar sign versus\\n\", 'presence of dollar sign. Although my two\\n', 'sense I hate that you have to remember all\\n', 'of these specific rules, and I wish, like they had, like, a generic way of doing\\n', 'this and not, like, too specific rules\\n', 'for you to remember. But unfortunately, we\\n', \"all have to remember that so that's to do\\n\", 'with the sort stage. Limit stage, as one would\\n', 'guess, is simplistic filter, enables you to\\n', 'limit the number of documents that come\\n', \"out of the pipeline. Now, let's go ahead and get started with the pipeline here. The first thing that\\n\", \"I'm going to do is to define my group stage. Let me go ahead and type in group and the dictionary\\n\", 'corresponding to that. What do I need to group by? So if I scroll up here, as I mentioned, it is\\n', 'host underscore name. So for the underscore ID field, I am going to\\n', \"specify the value as dollar and I cannot just say host name because that's a\\n\", 'subfield within a field. Hopefully all of\\n', 'you remember that host is the name of\\n', 'the parent field, so I need to specify host dot host underscore\\n', 'name and this is going to do group by host dot\\n', 'host underscore name. What do I want to do in\\n', 'order to do the calculation, I want to be able to find the hosts which have the\\n', 'most number of listings, so which means that I\\n', 'need to sum up the number of listings corresponding\\n', \"to each host. So I'm going to create a new\\n\", 'field called total listings, and the value is going to be a dictionary where I\\n', \"perform the computation. If you haven't already guessed, dollar sum is how you\\n\", 'do the summing up. What do I need to sum up? Every time I see the host name, I just need to add one\\n', \"to the value because we're just literally\\n\", \"incrementing a counter. So that's all I have here\\n\", 'for the group stage. Now, is there an\\n', 'easy way for you to verify the output that\\n', \"you're getting over here? Well, there should be. Give me a second. I wanted to show this saying. Let's just do this\\n\", \"with Esra's listings. I know that like here I\\n\", \"say Natalie's listings, let's just use Esra\\n\", \"instead. Give me a second. I'm just going to replace the variable name here with\\n\", \"Esra, instead of Natalie. So let's write a\\n\", 'find method call to confirm that Esra host\\n', \"actually has five listings. So it's not that complex\\n\", 'for you to do that. Your query here is now going to have host dot\\n', \"host underscore name. We're back to find,\\n\", 'so no dollar sign, host dot host underscore name, and I need to be able to match any listing where the\\n', \"host name is Esra. So let's go ahead and do that and let me scroll\\n\", 'up really quickly. Give me a second to\\n', \"get to where I was. Rather than doing this let's just compute the\\n\", 'length of this array. Apparently, Esra has\\n', 'actually five listings, and the group stage\\n', 'gave us a sum of five. So hopefully our code for\\n', 'the group stage is correct. This is how you verify\\n', 'individual stages before you move on to the\\n', 'next stage of the pipeline. Now that we have been able to do the grouping of the host, the next stage is going\\n', 'to be the sort stage. So let me type in\\n', 'a new dictionary. Sort is going to be\\n', 'the name of the stage. The value is going\\n', 'to be a dictionary, and you need to\\n', 'specify the name of the field based on which\\n', 'you want to do the sorting. Clearly, I want to sort\\n', 'by based on the number of listings corresponding\\n', 'to each host. And you once again need to\\n', 'specify one or minus one. I need, descending\\n', \"out of sort because I need top two host, so I'm going to\\n\", 'say negative one. And for the sort stage, I also need to mention the ID\\n', 'field to explicitly specify that the information\\n', 'is corresponding to the ID that we\\n', 'used in the grouping. So I need to specify\\n', 'underscore ID, and then I need to\\n', \"specify colon one. And I could test this that'll\\n\", 'give you all of the output, sorted using descending\\n', 'order based on the total number of listings, or you could just directly\\n', 'add on the limit stage, which is simple enough. So the limit stage is going\\n', 'to be the final stage. It takes direct value\\n', 'of the number of documents that you want the\\n', 'queries result to limit, which would be two. Any questions about\\n', 'sort or limit stages? >> Now, moving on to the\\n', 'most complex pipeline stage, which is the lookup stage. Lookup enables you to\\n', 'perform a left outer join to another collection\\n', 'in the same database. This is otherwise\\n', 'known as a join. So there were a couple\\n', 'of questions on Piazza about some of the\\n', 'earlier on questions, taking too much time to execute, because students are incorrectly using lookup to actually\\n', 'perform an outer join. You should not\\n', 'perform an outer join unless and until it\\n', 'is really essential. If you can solve a question, just by executing two\\n', 'different fine methods on two different collections, you should always give\\n', 'preference to that. Joins are very slow in MongoDB, mainly because we have\\n', \"semi structured data. So let's define the syntax\\n\", 'for the look up stage. You need to specify\\n', 'four specific fields. The from field is\\n', 'going to specify the name of the other collection that you want to\\n', 'include in your join. The local field is\\n', 'going to specify the name of the join field\\n', 'from the current collection. Foreign field is\\n', 'going to specify the name of the field from the collection that is mentioned using the from field over here. The as field is going to create a new name to the output\\n', \"of the join process, which always will be an array. So you're going to end\\n\", 'up with a new document, which is going to contain a\\n', 'new array field that contains all of the matching documents\\n', 'from the joint collection. So which means that your output of the lookup process\\n', 'is always going to be of array type inside\\n', \"your document type. So let's go ahead and learn\\n\", 'examples with lookup. Before I actually\\n', 'introduce unwind. Unwind is simple enough. It just enables you to\\n', \"deconstruct an array. We'll directly deal with unwind when we write the look up stage. In order to go go through\\n\", 'a question using joins, I obviously cannot use the Airbnb dataset because that only contains a\\n', \"single collection. So which means that we're\\n\", 'going to go back to our sample analytics database. I think I will have to load\\n', 'this one. Give me a second. I actually brought my VM down because I wanted\\n', \"to upgrade my VM, so I don't have that\\n\", 'collection at all. Because of this reason, give me a minute. I need to copy base\\n', 'the data from before, and I need to make\\n', 'sure that my database actually has that\\n', 'info populated. After here, give me a second, instead of this, I need\\n', 'to say sample analytics. Hopefully that will\\n', 'be quick enough. So recall that we have three\\n', \"different collections, accounts, and then customers. For the purpose of this example, we're going to stick\\n\", \"to just accounts and customers collection in order for me to demonstrate joins. And I'm going to show a\\n\", \"two way join for you. Let's get started with\\n\", \"one of the collections. I'm going to start with\\n\", \"accounts collections, so I'm going to try and mention the customers collection\\n\", 'fields as part of the dollar look\\n', 'up stage here. The very first stage\\n', 'here is going to be the dollar look up stage. The value corresponding to that is going to\\n', 'be a dictionary. And then you have four\\n', 'specific values to mention, which are going to\\n', 'be what is from. And then what is going\\n', 'to be local field. And then what do I mention\\n', 'for the foreign field? All of this is just syntax from the earlier syntax\\n', 'that we discussed. And then the last field\\n', 'is going to be AS, which gives you the name of the new merge document detail\\n', 'that you want to create. The from field needs to\\n', \"be the other collection. So clearly, that's going to be customers here because we're invoking aggregate the\\n\", 'method on accounts. The other one needs\\n', 'to be customers. The local field, now, local field is the\\n', 'field inside accounts, so as you can see,\\n', \"that is account_ID. Let me come over here. I'm going to paste that. What about the foreign field? Let's take a look at\\n\", 'customers collection. The account IDs are\\n', 'part of a list of all account IDs here corresponding to an\\n', 'individual customer. The join operation on MongoDB, as much as it is slow, it is very powerful. It can actually join in\\n', 'between two collections, where one has info\\n', 'as a regular field. The other one has info contained\\n', 'within an array field. Both the side join is\\n', 'going to be possible, list to individual field, individual field to list. Both of those are\\n', 'going to work out. So now I need to mention my foreign field\\n', 'as accounts here. And for as field, you can just mention\\n', 'whatever is relevant. For instance, you can just\\n', \"say account details here. Now, that's where I'm\\n\", \"going to leave this. And let's take a look at\\n\", 'the first joined document. So our base is going to be\\n', 'the accounts collection. So clearly, this is the document that\\n', \"we're going to update. So if you scroll down, you'll notice that there is a new field called\\n\", \"account_details, which I'm trying to\\n\", \"find where it is. Give me a minute here. Looks like I'll have to\\n\", \"actually search for it. We can't search inside\\n\", 'the output, my bad. So up until accounts is what you have here. What am I missing? Am I not able to see where\\n', 'the account details is? So we started off with\\n', 'accounts, my bad. Everything else is part\\n', 'of account details, so I was looking\\n', 'in the wrong spot. We started off with\\n', 'accounts, not customers. Accounts is the\\n', 'smaller collection. So all of the info from the\\n', 'account shows up before. And then followed by which, you have a new field\\n', 'called account_details, the value corresponding\\n', 'to that is going to be the matching document from\\n', 'the other collection. As you can see, one\\n', 'of these accounts is the same account number as\\n', \"the original document here. That's going to be the\\n\", 'output of the join process. As you can see,\\n', 'account details field, the new field that got\\n', 'created is of array type, and then you have an\\n', 'entire document in here, which refers to the\\n', 'matching document from the customers collection. Any questions about how lookup\\n', 'works as a basic thing? Now, to speak about unwind, as you can clearly see, the output of the\\n', 'join process using look up stage is always\\n', 'going to be of array type. So if you want to\\n', 'be able to extract individual fields\\n', \"from the arrays, you're going to have to use\\n\", 'the unwind stage for it, which is going to\\n', \"be the next stage that I'm going to type. So the name of stage\\n\", 'is going to be unwind and then followed by\\n', \"which you're going to specify the name of the field. You need to use a\\n\", 'dollar sign here. The name of the field\\n', 'here is going to be the new array that we created, which is going to be\\n', 'account_details over here. So if you take a look\\n', 'at the updated output, now you no longer have\\n', 'the annoying outer array. You only have like one of the\\n', 'other matching documents. Well, this comes\\n', 'in really handy. Whenever you have,\\n', 'like exact one on one match for your join process, gets more complicated\\n', \"when you have, like, multiple way joints. We're not going to go\\n\", 'through an example for that. Any questions about\\n', 'the results so far before we actually use project stage to extract\\n', 'the relevant result? One thing that I want to do, ignore the output, is to specify the project stage. And for the project stage, I am going to specify whatever fields\\n', \"are of significance. I don't want the ID, so I'm just going\\n\", 'to set ID to zero. I want the name of the customer to answer\\n', \"the original question, so I'm going to say name as one And now for the\\n\", 'remaining details, I need to be careful\\n', 'here because I need to specify the account ID, which can either come from\\n', 'account ID information here, or it could come\\n', \"from the join data. I'm just going to use\\n\", \"account ID information from in here. So I'm simply going\\n\", 'to say account_ ID, and then say one. And the limit is coming directly from the original document info, so that also needs to be\\n', 'one. I made a mistake here. The name is not coming from\\n', \"the original document, it's coming from inside\\n\", 'account_details. So instead of name, I need to say\\n', 'account_details.name, which will retrieve all of the relevant information\\n', 'that is necessary. Any questions at\\n', \"all about lookup? So in the interest of time, I'm actually going to go over\\n\", 'the completed version of the other way of doing\\n', \"the lookup process here. Just give me one minute. Let's copy paste the\\n\", 'updated solution. From in here, and\\n', \"then I'll simply talk about the other way around\\n\", \"instead of typing it. So the other way around, you're going to invoke aggregate\\n\", 'method using customers, and your from field is\\n', 'now going to be account, your local field is now going\\n', 'to change into accounts, and the foreign field is\\n', 'going to become account_ID. The only other thing\\n', 'that you need to worry about is to properly use, correct way of naming\\n', 'individual fields based on where that particular information\\n', \"is coming from, whether it's coming from\\n\", \"the original document or whether it's coming from\\n\", \"account_details here. Any questions at all? So I'm not going to go over the intuition behind the\\n\", 'usage of dollar sign again. I think we have\\n', 'spent enough time to go through those examples. In the interest of time, we have a few more\\n', \"questions to cover, so I'm actually going to go\\n\", 'over the completed version of the notebook so as to be able\\n', 'to wrap up those examples. Just give me a couple\\n', 'of minutes here to run the import statements, and let me scroll all\\n', 'the way down here. Now, there is one more, pipeline stage that I\\n', 'want you to be aware of, depending on how you solve\\n', 'the project questions you might or might not need\\n', 'to use this stage. But I still want\\n', 'to introduce it in case like you end up solving it, like I did, and there\\n', 'are a couple of ways of solving that\\n', 'particular project question. So add fields enables\\n', 'you to add a new field, similar to the project stage, excepting that you can add more conditions here because add fields enables you to apply specific conditions on\\n', 'the existing fields. So the syntax is very similar to what\\n', \"we've been seeing so far. Add fields is going to be\\n\", \"the name of the stage. And as a value, you're going to be mentioning a dictionary object instance. Within that, you're\\n\", 'going to specify a brand new field name which\\n', 'is what you want to create, for example,\\n', 'account_status here. And the value\\n', 'corresponding to that is how you want to\\n', 'populate that field. If you want to make\\n', 'that a constant, you could literally just like put in a constant value there. As opposed to that, you can write a\\n', 'conditional expression. Again, dollar condition is also an optional\\n', 'thing for you to run. For P3, you might or\\n', 'might not need it, depending on how you\\n', 'solve the question. So condition enables you\\n', 'to specify if then else. You have two different,\\n', 'syntax for it. Use either one that\\n', \"sounds good to you. If it's going to enable you to specify a condition,\\n\", \"for example, here, I'm specifying limit\\n\", 'greater than 9,000, then account status\\n', 'value should be high. Else it should be low, that enables us to create a brand new field\\n', 'called account_status. The only problem is I\\n', \"haven't run the database to populate account details. One other thing that\\n\", 'I want to quickly mention is something\\n', 'called add to set, which is another array method. Again, you might or\\n', 'might not need this, but I still want to mention you can look up\\n', 'the documentation if you think you would\\n', \"need that field. Let's actually wrap up the\\n\", 'last couple of examples. These are going to\\n', 'be really quick, so we should be able to finish them in the next\\n', \"couple of minutes. We'll skip top hat for today, but, I had a logistic\\n\", \"question anyway. I'll talk about that after we\\n\", 'finish these two examples. So the last three\\n', \"or four questions from the project are quite easy. You've already been\\n\", 'given code to create plot for your questions. You just need to\\n', 'make sure to copy paste that particular\\n', 'plot function. So a couple of things for\\n', 'you to learn about here. First question is going\\n', 'to ask you to list all of the Airbnb listings located\\n', 'in Hawaii and plot them. You just need to write a fine method to be able\\n', 'to answer this question, similar to the first\\n', 'geography question that you have from\\n', 'project P3 as well. So you need to find the field\\n', 'that is of significance in Airbnb data set that\\n', 'is a address.street. And I need a reg X\\n', \"match here because there isn't a field called city. So I need to explicitly\\n\", 'match for Hawaii. And then once I do that, I pass the relevant arguments. So I forgot to run the cell, and I pass the\\n', 'relevant arguments, and that should be able to run\\n', \"this code for some reason. I haven't executed some\\n\", \"of the cells before, so I'm running into this issue. If you have been following along and you've been\\n\", 'executing everything, you should be able\\n', \"to see a map here. I'm not going to spend\\n\", 'time on figuring out what exactly the GeoPandas error is because I want to talk about the last question in\\n', 'the last minute here. So for doing any kind of distance calculation\\n', 'on a geographic map, which happens to be a sphere\\n', 'and not like a flat line, like how we compared distances. Clearly, you cannot be using the regular distance\\n', 'calculation. In order to achieve that, you must create a brand new\\n', 'index on your collection. So the create_index method enables you to create\\n', 'a brand new index. Specifically, you need to\\n', 'create a 2D spear index, which enables you to calculate\\n', 'geographic distances between two different points\\n', 'using the near operator. You can compare the\\n', 'distance between the locations in your dataset and a specific\\n', \"coordinate location. In your project, you've\\n\", 'already been given a specific coordinate location for one or two of the questions. You just need to\\n', 'make sure to find the relevant location fields\\n', 'within your dataset and then invoke the appropriate\\n', \"find method and I'm going to\\n\", 'mention the name of the field as\\n', 'address.location here. The value needs to be application\\n', 'of the near operator. The near operator\\n', 'requires you to specify two things as key value pairs\\n', 'within a dictionary. Again, another exception\\n', 'for it not being a list, and it expecting a\\n', 'dictionary here. The first dictionary is going to specify the geometry\\n', 'for your comparison, your type is going to be\\n', \"always point object instance. We're not going to use\\n\", 'any other instance. And for coordinates, you need to specify the other\\n', 'set of coordinates, the ones that you want to\\n', 'do the comparison with. And Max distance enables you to specify a distance\\n', \"limit, for instance, like, I'm specifying find all\\n\", 'the listings within five kilometers\\n', 'of New York City.

So once you do this,\\n', 'assuming that port 8889 on your laptop is\\n', \"available for you to use, and it's not being occupied\\n\", \"by any other process, once you go back to the browser, you're going to have to change\\n\", 'the port number to 8889, the port number that I\\n', 'chose for my laptop to get mapped to the remote port\\n', '8888 on the virtual machine, and that should give\\n', 'you a connection to your Jupyter Notebook session.

So let me repeat the process so that it's\\n\", 'very clear to all of you. First of all, we launched\\n', 'a Docker Container, which is running MySQL server, and then I established\\n', 'a port forwarding between my VM and Docker\\n', 'Container. How do you do that? You use the -P option to configure that while you\\n', 'launch a Docker container. Second, after you do that,\\n', 'what do you have to do? Launch Jupyter Notebook on your virtual machine\\n', 'from the path where you actually have access\\n', 'to the notebook file, assuming that you want access to the template or the completed version of the notebook file. Once you launch the\\n', 'Jupyter Notebook process on your virtual machine, open a brand new tab\\n', 'within your terminal or PowerShell Window\\n', 'in order to be able to establish the SSH session. It is significant that you understand that this\\n', 'is a brand new tab. Why is that part significant? The SSH tunnel is supposed\\n', 'to establish a connection between your laptop and\\n', \"your virtual machine. If you're already inside\\n\", \"an existing SSH session, you're already inside\\n\", 'your virtual machine. A tunneling from the\\n', 'virtual machine to the virtual machine does not really make any sense because\\n', \"you're already there. So you need to open\\n\", 'a brand new tab or a new Window to establish\\n', 'the tunneled session, which you can achieve by using\\n', \"the -L option over here. Any questions at all about this, it's very important\\n\", 'that all of you be able to do this after\\n', \"today's lecture, if not during the lecture. Question. [BACKGROUND]\\n\", \"SSH tunnel is a one way connection. You're saying source IP address, source port destination, IP address destination port. If you want the other\\n\", \"way connection, you're somehow going to have\\n\", 'to enable it on your GCPVM. [BACKGROUND] Yes. I think I misunderstood\\n', \"your question. I'll talk about what\\n\", \"I mentioned later on. Let's not confuse other people. Any other questions? So I needed to make absolutely sure that\\n\", \"I'm slowing down here. So, notice that there\\n\", 'are two notebook files. Let me talk about the\\n', 'completed version first. You have a couple of options with respect to lecture demo. You can either use the\\n', 'template notebook file. Let me also open that one. In order to follow along\\n', \"with me during the lecture, do this if you're really\\n\", 'good with typing. I know how to type fast. If you can type at my\\n', 'pace, you can try that. As opposed to that, the\\n', 'alternate option is to open the completed version of the notebook file and\\n', 'just follow along. What I would recommend in\\n', \"general is after the lecture, if you're using the completed version of the notebook file, go back to the template and see whether you're able to repeat\\n\", 'whatever code I wrote.

Any questions at all about template versus completed\\n', \"version of the notebook file? So I'm going to\\n\", 'show you one thing.

You're welcome to\\n\", \"use Jupyter Lab that feels comfortable to you. I'm just going to stick\\n\", 'to Jupyter Notebook. Let me ask start asking a\\n', 'question to the last few rules.

So the very first thing\\n', 'that I want to go through, it is likely that you would\\n', \"have already installed Pandas on your virtual machine if you haven't done\\n\", 'that by any chance, or if you want to learn how\\n', 'to do the installation for packages inside a\\n', \"Jupyter Notebook, I'm going to show\\n\", 'you how to do that.

So basics of Jupyter\\n', 'Notebook, again, please teach yourself\\n', 'keyboard shortcuts that would make you faster. Going back to creating\\n', 'the engine connection, the syntax for that\\n', 'is I need to say MySQL and then MySQL connector. And then I need to\\n', 'specify my user. Recall that in Docker, everything is run\\n', 'using root user, so this needs to be root. And the next thing should\\n', \"be MySQL username. And then at the IP address where I'm running\\n\", 'my MySQL server, followed by which\\n', \"you're going to mention the port number. So let me say IP:PORT here.

That's okay because we're only in a development\\n\", \"environment. Please don't do this ever in\\n\", 'a production environment. And then what is my IP address? This is going to be the Loopback interface IP address 127.0.0.1. Recall that we\\n', 'established a connection between the virtual machines\\n', 'Loopback IP address 127.0.0.0.1 and\\n', \"port number 3306. So that's the port number\\n\", \"that you're looking for. Port number 3306. Followed by which\\n\", \"you're going to specify the name\\n\", 'of the database, which we configured as CS 639. Any questions on any of the details that\\n', \"I'm mentioning here, or basic information for you\\n\", 'to establish a connection. So how do you actually\\n', 'establish a connection? Create engine returns an\\n', 'engine object instance. Using the engine\\n', \"object instance, you're going to invoke\\n\", 'a method called connect difference between\\n', 'a function and a method. Create engine is a function. You did not use an object\\n', 'instance to invoke that. As opposed to that, connect\\n', \"is a method because I'm using the engine object instance\\n\", 'to invoke the method. This is going to, if everything was fine, I think I have like\\n', 'one more thing to fix. I had a couple of angle\\n', 'brackets over there. If everything were to be\\n', 'fine with your syntax, that would have\\n', 'helped you establish the connection to\\n', 'your MySQL server. So how do you run the show tables command\\n', 'that I showed you on the command line which enable you to access\\n', \"MySQL server. So you're going to use\\n\", 'the execute method with your connection\\n', 'object instance by saying conn.execute. Within this, you cannot just say show tables and then\\n', 'followed by a semicolon. The argument to execute method needs to be a text\\n', 'object instance. Remember that we imported\\n', 'text from SQL alchemy. So all of your queries\\n', 'that you run using the execute method should be in the form of\\n', 'text object instance. You can do that by instantiating\\n', 'text, open parenthesis, and the argument is going to be your SQL query and then close\\n', 'parentheses after that. Any questions at all so far? So this returns SQL alchemy cursor\\n', 'result object instance. What do we do with it? It works very simply as a list, you can just convert that into an actual list\\n', 'by using list, open parentheses,\\n', 'closed parentheses surrounding the\\n', \"entire expression. And that should give you nothing because we don't\\n\", \"have any tables. An anti-climatic thing. We'll add tables\\n\", 'shortly before that. Any questions on the basic\\n', 'connectivity before we move on to learning how\\n', \"to create our own tables. So, table creation. Let's mimic our learning\\n\", 'management system. Recall that we had a\\n', \"student table that's going to be the very first table that we are going to create. In order to show\\n\", \"you SQL queries, I'm going to introduce\\n\", 'a new syntax. Hopefully, all of you are\\n', 'familiar with the fact that you can\\n', 'represent some string using either double quotations or single quotations in Python. In order to be able to split the string\\n', 'across multiple lines, you can use triple\\n', 'double quotations. For example, I can type\\n', 'some string and then type some after the triple\\n', 'double quotation and then string after that and then followed by triple\\n', 'double quotation. That would insert\\n', \"new line characters in between those two lines, but that's okay because\\n\", \"a SQL query can be split across multiple lines that's not going to cause you any harm. You'll find myself often using triple double quotations\\n\", 'for writing SQL queries. Because that will\\n', 'enable you to format your SQL query to\\n', \"ensure that you don't go beyond 80 characters. If you ever were to print your notebook file\\n\", 'on a sheet of paper, it would be a pain if your\\n', 'character limit exceeds a certain limit because the wrap around does\\n', 'not work on a printer. It will just simply cut off\\n', 'the additional characters. Also, readability, both\\n', \"of those use cases. So, let's write our very\\n\", \"first create query here. I'm going to type conn.execute, and let me try triple\\n\", \"double quotations, and I'm going to type MySQL\\n\", 'query in between these two. So, SQL is case insensitive. You can either say create with capital case letters or\\n', 'all small case letters. It does not really matter. And then the syntax for\\n', 'creating a table is to say create table followed\\n', 'by your table name. And then within a\\n', \"pair of parentheses, you're going to be\\n\", 'mentioning each of your attribute name along\\n', 'with type of the attribute. What is an attribute column is also referred to\\n', 'as an attribute. Let me type and enter\\n', 'over here so that we can split individual columns\\n', \"into individual lines. So if you scroll up, you're told what exactly are the attribute names\\n\", 'or the column names. You have sid, name,\\n', 'and your gpa. So let me go ahead\\n', 'and create sid, which is going to\\n', \"be integer type, name that's going\\n\", \"to be text type. Let's say that you do not\\n\", 'want the name to be null, you can enforce\\n', 'constraints like not null. So as to not have any entry within your students table that does not have\\n', \"a name column value. And let's make GPA\\n\", 'as float over here. The only other missing thing is, how do you specify that your student ID is\\n', \"the primary key? The syntax for that, you have two different syntax. I'll show you one way first. At the end of all\\n\", 'of your list of attributes and\\n', 'your column types, you can mention\\n', 'primary space key and mention the\\n', 'name of the column, which is supposed to\\n', \"be a primary key. I'll show you\\n\", \"another syntax when we create, give me a second. Oh, I'm missing text, aren't I? It needs to be a text\\n\", 'object instance. So now, if we go back and re execute the\\n', \"show tables command, I'm going to copy paste. Feel free to type\\n\", 'it from scratch. If you want, practice, that should show the\\n', \"student's table. Any questions on create query basics of how to create a brand new\\n\", \"table from scratch. Let's run a couple\\n\", 'of insert queries in order to be able to\\n', \"insert data into our table. You've been asked to insert\\n\", 'the row from the slide. Feel free to add whatever\\n', 'details that you want to add instead of following along with whatever I have given here. Let me give you an example\\n', 'where I use capital cases. Insert is the query that\\n', 'you need to insert data, insert into a table name\\n', \"that would be students, followed by which you'll mention a list of attributes like a1, a2, et cetera. What are the attributes. And then after that, you're going to have to\\n\", \"specify the keyword values, followed by which you'll\\n\", \"have the actual values. So I've given you the syntax, go ahead and try writing the\\n\", \"insert query on your own. I'm also going to\\n\", 'finish mine up shortly. Feel free to add another\\n', 'student as well. I have one more cell where\\n', 'you can add one more student. >> Any questions on INSERT\\n', 'or CREATE SQL queries? Now, projection, otherwise known as the\\n', 'SELECT SQL clause. You might have heard of\\n', 'the SELECT SQL clause, but not the terminology\\n', 'projection. That is what is going\\n', 'to enable you to retrieve all or specific columns\\n', 'from a particular table. The terminology\\n', 'that is going to be used in the world of SQL\\n', 'is called a projection. Projection is nothing but\\n', 'just writing a SELECT clause. I can achieve any\\n', \"querying based query. Let me backtrack, shouldn't\\n\", 'have said achieved. I can run any querying\\n', 'based query on my database tables easily\\n', \"using pandas module, read_sql function, that's what we are going to be using to\\n\", 'execute our very first query, which is about\\n', \"retrieving the data. I'm going to say SELECT*, asterisk indicates get\\n\", 'me all of the columns, and I need to say a FROM\\n', 'clause, followed by which, I need to say the\\n', 'name of the table. And then, the second\\n', 'argument needs to be the connection object\\n', 'instance reference, which we call that is stored\\n', 'within the variable conn, that should hopefully\\n', 'give you the two rows that you inserted or maybe\\n', 'more than that you inserted. Any questions on difference between using conn.execute for schema-based changes or\\n', 'operations on the database itself versus using read_sql to do querying from\\n', \"the database data? Let's move on to the next part, which is about updating data. The UPDATE query\\n\", \"enables you to change information that is already available within your SQL table. For instance, let's\\n\", \"say that we want to change Alice's GPA to 3.7, I'm going to achieve that by using UPDATE query\\n\", \"followed by typing. I'm going to type\\n\", \"table name then the keyword is going to be set, what column equal to new value? That's how you type\\n\", 'in an UPDATE query. What is the column name here? GPA. I type that in\\n', 'with lower cases, and then I need to set\\n', 'the new value as 3.7, and I need to specify which\\n', 'row to do the update on. WHERE clause is\\n', \"the clause that's going to enable you\\n\", 'to specify that. Let me mention the condition WHERE clause is always\\n', \"associated with the condition. Here, that's going\\n\", \"to be equality. I'm going to say sid=, and then I'm going\\n\", \"to mention 101. 101 is Alice's student ID, so I need that primary\\n\", 'key unique identifier to be able to say that. Any questions on this before\\n', \"we repeat the SELECT query? I'm just going to copy paste. Again, feel free to type the\\n\", 'SELECT query from scratch. Hopefully, you should\\n', \"see an updated GPA for Alice's 3.7 here. Any questions at all before\\n\", \"we move on to the next table? So I've given you\\n\", 'what you need to do, to write the CREATE query\\n', \"for the courses table. Go ahead and try it yourself. I'm also going to type the\\n\", \"same query at the same time. Please do try it on your own. Also right after this, let's do top hat, giving\\n\", 'all of you heads-up. What did I do? This is the other way of\\n', 'specifying primary key. Previously, I told you that at the end of your CREATE query, you can mention primary key and then mention the\\n', 'name of the column, which is supposed to\\n', 'be the primary key. Alternate option\\n', 'would be for you to mention primary key right after defining the type of\\n', \"that particular column itself. Let's actually do table deletion before we do the\\n\", 'top hat question, but please open top hat. I just want to give all of you some more time to open top hat. Table deletion, what if you\\n', \"wanted to delete a table? For instance, let's say that I decide that I want to go ahead and delete the courses table. The query for that\\n\", 'is to say drop, and then followed by which\\n', \"you mentioned table. And then after that, you're going to mention\\n\", 'the table name, which would be\\n', \"courses in this case. So I've asked you to\\n\", \"recreate courses table. This time I've asked you to\\n\", 'make cid type as VARCHAR 255. Go ahead and write the query. Feel free to copy\\n', \"paste, if you want to. Write the query for that, and also open top hat. I'm going to pop up the\\n\", 'top hat question shortly. Just so that I can\\n', \"get your attention, we're doing top\\n\", 'hat. Top hat is on. You have some time to\\n', 'answer the question. Just make sure to\\n', 'hit \"Submit,\" after you\\'re done answering\\n', 'the question. Please click \"Submit.\" Majority of you got\\n', 'the correct answer. Recall that we already\\n', 'covered the theory for this. Foreign key is how you establish relationship\\n', 'between tables. Primary key enables you\\n', 'to figure out a way to uniquely identify data\\n', \"rows within your table. It doesn't really enable you to establish relationship\\n\", 'across tables. Foreign key is what\\n', \"you need for that. So that's going to be the\\n\", \"next thing that we do. I'm actually going to skip over inserting the two courses\\n\", 'from the table or rather, let me go to the\\n', 'completed Notebook file. By now, I think all of you have a good sense of how\\n', 'the INSERT query works. Feel free to go through these INSERT query examples from the completed version\\n', \"of the Notebook file. Now, let's go ahead\\n\", 'and create a table, which is now going to have\\n', 'a foreign key relationship. Enrolled table is\\n', 'going to be the table. So let me say, create table. Table name is going\\n', 'to be enrolled, and I need to mention a\\n', 'list of column names, and those are going\\n', 'to be sid int, which is supposed to\\n', \"be a foreign key. We'll come back to that\\n\", 'relationship part later. For now, just define a column and its\\n', 'type, and then cid, which is going to\\n', 'be varchar type, and for varchar, you need to specify\\n', \"the number of bytes. So that's going to be 255, and then let's say, the last one is\\n\", 'going to be grade, which is of text type. Now, after having mentioned\\n', \"the column names, you're going to have to mention the foreign key relationship. The syntax for that is\\n\", \"to say, foreign key, and you're going to\\n\", 'specify what is the name of the key in the current table, which could be different. I could have chosen to name the current student ID column\\n', \"as stud_id if I wanted to, but I'm just retaining\\n\", \"the same name. So I'm saying the current table, what is the column name, which is sid, and then I need to\\n\", 'say references, what table, and then\\n', 'what column name? What is the name of the\\n', 'table that should go here? Where is sid coming from\\n', 'primarily? Students table. Excellent. So I need\\n', 'to say students, and then the name of the\\n', \"column there as well as sid. Again, you're going\\n\", 'to have to repeat the same thing\\n', 'this time for cid. And what should\\n', 'be the name here, that should be the\\n', 'courses course? So it is important that you\\n', \"run those insert queries. Without that, you're not\\n\", 'going to be able to establish that particular relationship\\n', \"and I have some typo. MySQL errors are such a pain. You're going to have\\n\", 'to scroll through all of this to figure\\n', \"out what's wrong. I have an error in MySQL\\n\", \"syntax. I'm missing a comma? [OVERLAPPING]\\n\", 'Excellent. Thank you. Pain, but you have to go through there to be able to\\n', \"figure out what's wrong. Thank you for the\\n\", 'error notification. So if you do show tables, you should now be able to\\n', \"see three different tables. Again, I'm going to just copy paste the enrollment\\n\", 'INSERT queries, because I want to be able to\\n', 'wrap up this demo quickly. So the first one\\n', 'is going to insert the very first enrollment. Let me do that. All of these examples are\\n', \"directly from the slide deck, and I'm going to show\\n\", 'SELECT* from courses now. Any questions on the syntax for establishing foreign\\n', 'key relationships? So a couple of things\\n', 'for you to think about. What if we try to enroll\\n', 'a non-existing student? Taking a leaf of Arya Stark\\n', \"from Game of Thrones, I'm going to try to\\n\", 'insert no one with nothing as information\\n', 'into my enrolled table. Do you think this will work? How many of you\\n', \"think it'll work? Put up one finger, how many\\n\", \"of you think it won't work? Put up two fingers.\\n\", \"I see a lot of twos. Excellent. This will not work. It's going to dump\\n\", 'a bunch of errors. Again, you got to scroll through that whole stack to be able\\n', 'to get to the bottom of it. What does the error say? Cannot add or\\n', 'update a child row, because a foreign key\\n', 'constraint failed. What was the constraint here? There is no student with Student ID 10 within\\n', \"the student's table. So obviously, you cannot\\n\", 'enroll a student into the enrolled table with\\n', \"the Student ID 10, because that's supposed\\n\", \"to be a foreign key. Doesn't work? What's the node that I had\\n\", \"in my completed version? Just give me one second. No foreign key mapping. That's the key here. And how do you comment out code by selecting a few\\n\", 'lines in Jupyter Notebook? Keyboard shortcut\\n', 'command forward slash or control forward\\n', 'slash, I think, on Windows, that will\\n', \"make that big error chunk go away because that's\\n\", 'annoying to most of us. Now, one final piece of\\n', 'the puzzle with respect to being able to create\\n', 'databases from scratch, you have to commit\\n', 'the transaction. Hopefully, all of you remember\\n', 'the term transaction from the previous lecture discussion\\n', 'on OLAP versus OLTP. Transaction stands for\\n', 'row-based changes that you do. At least SQL databases\\n', 'are primarily row-based. It is essential that you\\n', 'commit your transaction by using your connection\\n', \"object instance and invoking the commit method. Why is this significant? Let's see that you've done\\n\", 'all of this data entry. And your VM or your Docker container\\n', 'decides to crash on you. Well, for us, if the\\n', \"Docker container crashes, we're pretty much screwed\\n\", 'because all of the data within the database is inside\\n', \"the Docker container. Let's just take a\\n\", 'good case scenario where your VM crashes. Now your data will not be well, that will also be a problem. Assuming that you have\\n', 'your MySQL server running on your VM and you have\\n', \"your data committed, then there won't\\n\", 'be any data loss. This is how you\\n', 'ensure that the data is backed up by\\n', 'committing transactions. So last example that I\\n', 'want to go through here, what if we try to delete Student ID 101 from\\n', \"the student's table. As one might guess, this will also\\n\", 'through an error if you scroll all the\\n', \"way down here. Give me a second. This time, it's\\n\", 'going to be about not being able to\\n', 'delete a parent row because there is\\n', \"a child row with the foreign key relationship. So this also doesn't work\\n\", 'because of similar reasons. Once again, commenting\\n', 'out a block of code, select all the code command and forward slash or control\\n', 'and forward slash. Any questions at all about the basic SQL queries\\n', \"before we learn how to take a table's data from a CSV file and load it\\n\", \"onto a database table? I'm going to use Spotify\\n\", \"as an example over here, because it's a\\n\", \"simplistic example. I've already given\\n\", \"you the base URL. I'm going to use the\\n\", 'pandas.read_csv module. Let me use the base\\n', \"URL over here, and I'm going to specify my Spotify ZIP file name,\\n\", 'which is spotify.zip.

Speaking of Docker container\\n', 'being up and running, I have some good\\n', \"news for all of you. Starting with Project P4, we'll be moving on to a\\n\", 'slightly bigger sized VM, which possibly means\\n', \"that you don't potentially have to bring\\n\", 'the Docker container down between falling along with the lecture material versus\\n', \"solving the project. Hopefully, that'll\\n\", 'come in handy. So hopefully, all\\n', 'of you remember how to establish the connection. You need to create a client object instance\\n', 'using MongoClient. And then once you do that, you need to set your database by mentioning client\\n', 'object instance variable dot and then\\n', 'a database name here. As we discussed last lecture, this is a lazy\\n', 'database creation. What that means is\\n', 'that the database does not get\\n', 'instantaneously created unless and until you\\n', 'actually load content into the database by using one\\n', 'or the other mechanism. We use the insert_one to load each data into the\\n', 'corresponding collection. So once you execute the very first document\\n', \"insertion query, that's when the database\\n\", 'actually gets created. So for the purpose of\\n', \"today's lecture examples, let's work with these\\n\", 'two collections, which are inspections and trips. So for a majority of the API function calls\\n', 'that I have over here, actually method\\n', 'calls, my apologies, APA method calls, I provided you the\\n', 'documentation link. I would recommend you to go through the\\n', 'documentation link if you want to learn more details other than what is being\\n', 'covered during the lecture, sometimes that might\\n', 'be necessary for you to solve some of\\n', \"the project questions. So there might be situations where I'll give you\\n\", 'a list of operators, but not exactly go\\n', 'through each operator in a specific query. I would still hope that you all will be able to use\\n', \"all of the operators that I list because we've spent quite a significant amount of time learning similar\\n\", \"search operators with SQL. Let's learn the very\\n\", 'first API method, which is going to be\\n', \"the find method here. So you'll have to specify the database object\\n\", 'instance variable, which we have inside\\n', 'the variable DB, and the name of the collection. Name of the collection\\n', 'can be very easily accessed by using this method\\n', 'name list_collection_names. This is going to list all of the collections\\n', 'that you loaded. Each one will correspond to each JSON file that\\n', \"you previously loaded. We have two collections here which are inspections and trips. So we'll either way be saying\\n\", \"db.inspections or db.trips. And the method name is find, and it has three arguments. I'm only going to talk\\n\", \"about the first two. I'm not going to be\\n\", 'showing you any examples with the options that are given. Again, feel free to\\n', 'explore on your own. The first argument is\\n', 'going to be the query, which is going to enable\\n', 'you to specify what kind of filtering that you\\n', 'want to perform from the original\\n', 'collections documents. And the second parameter is something called\\n', \"as projection. So let's go through\\n\", 'some details here. First of all, the find method is going to return something\\n', 'called the cursor, which will enable you to iterate over the result set from\\n', 'your MongoDB database. A cursor object instance\\n', 'is an iterator. Because it is an iterator, you can very easily convert that into any kind of iterable. Recall that list sequence\\n', 'is a type of iterable, which means that you can\\n', 'very easily say list of the result from the\\n', 'find method and convert the result into a list instead of using the\\n', \"cursor to do iteration. Let's talk more details\\n\", \"about the parameters here, and I'll show you\\n\", 'an example shortly. The query parameter is\\n', 'going to be equivalent to selection operations,\\n', 'selection filtering. Can someone remind\\n', 'me what clause in SQL enables us to\\n', 'perform selection? You guys got this.\\n', \"You've been writing SQL queries for quite\\n\", 'a while now. Yes. >> [inaudible]. >> I thought I did\\n', \"that. My apologies. I'll push it after the lecture. I don't want to\\n\", 'disrupt the lecture. Thank you for letting me\\n', \"know. I thought I pushed it. I'll make sure to push it\\n\", 'right after the lecture. Again, going back\\n', 'to my question, which SQL clause enables us to perform selection? WHERE clause. Excellent. It is not\\n', 'the SELECT clause. Please remember that SELECT\\n', \"represents projection. This is the second parameter that we're talking about here. So the query argument is\\n\", \"similar to the WHERE clause. You're going to have to specify your field value pairs\\n\", 'separated by a comma, field and value will be\\n', 'separated by a colon, and the entire argument\\n', 'to the query parameter will be enclosed within\\n', 'a pair of curly braces, just like how you would enclose a JSON structure within\\n', 'a pair of curly braces. The value corresponding to individual fields can\\n', \"just be a single value, meaning that you're\\n\", \"going to apply equality comparison operator, or it could involve conditions. And we'll go through a bunch of examples to understand that. And the projection parameter is going to take\\n\", 'an argument that determines which fields are returned in the\\n', 'matching documents. Hopefully, all of you remember\\n', 'that SELECT clause in SQL is equivalent to performing\\n', 'the projection operation. So with respect to projection,\\n', \"you're going to again, have a similar format, field value pairs\\n\", 'separated by a comma. The field itself is going to be represented\\n', 'the name of the field, and the value can\\n', 'either be zero or one, depending on whether\\n', 'or not you want the projection to retrieve\\n', \"that value versus not. Let's go ahead and use\\n\", 'the find method to explore the trips collection. So first of all,\\n', \"I'll have to type, let me actually zoom in\\n\", 'a little bit, db.trips, db., and then the name\\n', 'of the collection, which is trips, and the method name\\n', 'is going to be find open parentheses,\\n', \"close parentheses. Notice that I'm not passing any arguments at all\\n\", 'that is allowed. So as I mentioned, this returns\\n', 'a cursor object instance, and a cursor is an iterator. So if you take a look at\\n', \"just the cursor variable, it'll mention that it is a pymongo cursor\\n\", 'object instance type. You can very easily\\n', 'convert the cursor into a list object instance by\\n', 'saying list open parenthesis, cursor, close parenthesis. This is the entire\\n', 'collection itself. So one thing that I\\n', 'would like to mention at the top of us starting\\n', 'to use Mongo APA calls is that Jupiter does not do\\n', 'great when you have a display of a huge JSON content. So if you were to display the entire file here and\\n', 'if you were to come back, scroll up, scroll\\n', 'down, annoyingly, it actually collapses\\n', \"this display window, and you literally have the entire document on your screen, which is very annoying. So what I would recommend is even if you're\\n\", 'trying to solve a question and your\\n', 'question involves more than three or four documents\\n', 'within your collection, I would still say use list slicing to display the Top 3\\n', 'or the last three and so on, so as to not get your Jupiter Notebook output\\n', 'into an annoying state. So let me talk about exploring\\n', 'an individual document. First of all, the\\n', 'entire collection is represented using this\\n', 'outer data structure, which clearly is a list. And each document inside is going to be enclosed\\n', \"within curly braces. And I'm just trying\\n\", 'to highlight. I think I highlighted\\n', 'two documents. My bad. Trying to highlight the very\\n', 'first document over here. As you can see, this is the structure of the\\n', 'current document. So this document\\n', 'has fields like ID, tripduration, start station ID, and so on, and then the\\n', 'corresponding values. You have a couple of\\n', 'other types in there. You have another\\n', 'dictionary object instance representing the start\\n', 'station location. Within there, you have the\\n', 'coordinates inside an array. Otherwise, can be thought\\n', 'of as a list here. So those are the\\n', 'structures that you have. Just give me one second. I am going to just make sure to show you how to apply\\n', \"slicing over here. I'm going to capture\\n\", 'the return value here into variable called\\n', 'trips instead of displaying all of the potential\\n', 'trips and just going to display the Top 3 by\\n', 'saying Column 3 here. Sorry. Give me a\\n', \"second. What did I do? My bad. It's good\\n\", 'that I did this. So cursor is an iterator. Once you use it, you\\n', 'cannot use it back again. So I rerun this notebook cell. The cursor no longer works\\n', \"because it's done iterating through all of my result\\n\", 'set from Mongo DB. This is why I had the same find method call repeated inside the\\n', 'second notebook cell. So always keep your\\n', 'method call and the list conversion within the exact same notebook\\n', 'cell so as to not do this. So this will give you\\n', 'just the Top 3 documents from the trips stable. Any questions at all on the basics of how\\n', \"to use find method? >> Let's do the same thing. This time. Give me a second\\n\", \"to get rid of the typo. I'm just going to copy paste. This time, instead of inspecting\\n\", 'the trips collection, we are going to inspect the\\n', 'inspections collection. So let me use an\\n', 'appropriate variable here. These two are going to be the two datasets that we\\n', 'are going to work with. Once again, you have\\n', 'your documents over here inside your original list and the top three documents are\\n', 'going to get displayed here. So this is the equivalent of saying select star\\n', 'from table name query, just like the\\n', 'exploration query that I asked all of you\\n', 'to run on all of your database\\n', 'tables initially to get yourself familiarized\\n', 'with the schema. The only catch here is\\n', \"that you don't have a fixed schema because we're not going to be enforcing\\n\", 'the schema here. So individual documents can have different field\\n', 'value pairs over here. Right after we finish\\n', \"Q1, let's do top hat. I'm giving all of your\\n\", 'heads up so that you can get your devices to do\\n', 'the top hat question. So we saw how to execute\\n', 'the select star from table name query on\\n', \"Mongo DB collections. Now let's learn how to do the\\n\", 'select star from table and have a wear class and perform some form\\n', 'of selection there. So here is a question. Find all the trips taken by\\n', 'passengers born in 1988. Can one of you go\\n', 'through the output from the trips document\\n', 'and tell me which is the field name that\\n', 'we are interested here? I want to be able to find all the trips taken by\\n', 'passengers born in 1988. You guys got this. Yeah.\\n', 'Birth year, excellent. This is what you\\n', \"are looking for. I'm going to copy paste this\\n\", 'so as to not make any typos. Now, let me start typing the\\n', 'query here. What happened? I have no idea why. There we go. My cursor\\n', 'was stuck there. Db.collection name,\\n', 'which is strips, find open parentheses,\\n', \"close parentheses. I'm going to apply a query here in order to\\n\", 'perform the selection, that needs to be\\n', 'the first argument, needs to be enclosed within open curly braces,\\n', 'close curly braces. For proper formatting, I would encourage you\\n', 'to just press an enter, if you want to just make\\n', \"your code readable, you're going to have to specify field name value pair,\\n\", 'separated by comma. I only have one were\\n', 'clause condition here, which is the birth year field, having a value of 1988. That is pretty much\\n', 'all that I need. But the only trouble\\n', 'is this will return a cursor object instance. So let me capture the return\\n', \"value into a variable and then I'm going to convert trips into a list\\n\", 'object instance, capture the same into the exact same variables so\\n', 'as to just be able to display the top three trips taken by\\n', 'passengers who were born. Actually, these are cycling trips by the bicyclists who\\n', \"were born in the year 1988. There's a special reason\\n\", \"I chose the year 1988. Let's see if any of you are able to figure out why this year is of significance to me by\\n\", \"the end of today's lecture. If you find it, come tell me. Let's do top hat. I literally gave you the\\n\", 'answer to this question, so you should know the\\n', \"answer from today's lecture. Please make sure to submit your response if you\\n\", \"haven't already done that. The correct answer\\n\", \"is definitely no. That's the whole point of having a non relational\\n\", 'database implementation. If you want, you could\\n', 'potentially enforce this. But most of the times the JSON schema\\n', \"enforcement is not made. That's the whole\\n\", 'point of us working with semi structured data. The data has some structure\\n', 'that is like you do have the JSON structure\\n', \"formatting there, but you're not enforcing\\n\", 'things like primary key, foreign key, or even the\\n', 'names of your fields. A document can have\\n', 'five fields versus another document can have\\n', 'six fields and so on. Hopefully, that is clear. Also, while you all were\\n', 'answering the top hat question, I pushed the code\\n', \"for today's lecture. My apologies, I thought\\n\", \"that I had pushed it. Please do a get poll. If you do a get poll, you should be able to get it and if you're not able to do it, just raise your hand\\n\", 'and let me know. Now, next question, find all inspection sectors. Again, there is a reason we\\n', 'did the exploration before. So let me scroll up to the inspection collection\\n', 'output over here. As you can see, there is a\\n', \"field name called sectors. You've been asked to find\\n\", \"all the inspection sectors. So specifically, let's only select the sector\\n\", 'fields value here so that I can demonstrate how the projection parameter\\n', \"works within the fine method. So I'm going to have to\\n\", 'say df.inspections.find, and I need to be\\n', 'able to find all of the sectors for all\\n', \"of the inspections. Unfortunately, as we all know, there isn't a way for\\n\", 'you to pass argument to just the second parameter unless and until you use\\n', \"named keyword arguments, which I don't want to, so I'm just going to pass an empty dictionary to\\n\", \"the first argument. I don't want to\\n\", 'do any selection. I only want to do projection\\n', 'because I want to select specific column from a\\n', \"table equivalent to that, if you think about SQL query. So I'm going to specify my projection as\\n\", 'another dictionary. As I mentioned, you need\\n', 'to have field value pairs. I only want the sector field, and I want to be able to\\n', \"retrieve the sector field, so I'm just going to\\n\", 'specify the value as one so as to indicate that I want to\\n', 'retrieve the sector field. Once again, let me store the cursor object instance\\n', \"into a variable called cursor, and then I'm going to convert the cursor into a\\n\", \"list object instance, and let's display the top five\\n\", 'inspections, for instance. What am I missing? DB, not DF. I use pandas is too much that automatically my brain\\n', 'types DF somehow. That looks like the\\n', \"output that we want, but also doesn't look like\\n\", \"the output that we want. What is this ID field? I really don't want that. So as I mentioned, if you don't want a field, you can always specify\\n\", \"the name of the field and don't use double\\n\", \"quotations around the string. I copy paste name of the field, and then I'm going to mention\\n\", \"zero to indicate that I don't want that\\n\", 'field to be displayed. Now only have the sectors. So whenever you pause, projection argument to the\\n', 'second parameter here, you return the list or the list that got converted\\n', 'from the cursor is now only going to have the\\n', 'fields that you indicate within the second argument\\n', 'dictionary over here. Any questions on how to specify the arguments\\n', 'for find method. So I jumped myself ahead and I answered this\\n', \"question in the previous cell. Let's move to the next question, which is going to\\n\", 'introduce how to use in operator within\\n', 'your where clause. Find all inspections that\\n', \"occurred in specific sectors. That's what I have over here. Let me actually copy paste from the previous L because\\n\", 'we are working with the inspections collection here instead of, give me a second. And instead of me having to specify the\\n', 'projection argument now, we now have to work with\\n', 'the selection argument. So I am going to apply the wnere clause to\\n', 'the sector field. So my field name is going to be sector within my dictionary. And then if it were\\n', 'just one value, I could just literally\\n', \"mention the value here after the colon, but I'm going to work with being able to find two different\\n\", 'types of sectors here, which are home improvement\\n', 'contractor hundred and home improvement\\n', 'salesperson 101. So because I need to find\\n', \"both of those occurrences, I'm going to have to\\n\", 'use the in operator. So whenever you have a condition that you\\n', \"need to specify, you're going to have to specify the details inside\\n\", \"another dictionary. So I'm going to have\\n\", 'to say sector Colon, and then the dictionary\\n', 'the dictionary, the operator that I want to apply is going to\\n', 'be the in operator. The syntax in general for\\n', 'any kind of operator, other than equality itself, even equality has a\\n', 'written down operator with name is going to be dollar\\n', 'sign followed by which we are going to\\n', 'specify the operator and the entire operator will be enclosed within\\n', \"double quotations because it's a string\\n\", \"representation. So this is the in operator, $in, that's how\\n\", 'you indicate that. And as the value to this\\n', 'operator that I want to apply, I have more than one\\n', 'value as one might guess, I need to specify a list corresponding to\\n', 'this particular key, and the items within the list are going to be what\\n', \"you're searching for here. So let me copy\\n\", 'paste those things so as to not make typo\\n', 'from the question here and this will give you\\n', 'all of the home inspections. Let me just change the variable here\\n', \"instead of inspections. Let's say, home inspections. And I'm only displaying the\\n\", \"top five home inspections. I'm sure you have way more than top five home\\n\", \"inspections here. All of them happened to be home improvement contractor 100, but maybe let's\\n\", 'try, bottom five. Maybe that can help us find 101. I did five colon instead of saying colon five the\\n', 'other way around. What was I going for? This is the top five and\\n', 'if I need the bottom five, I need to specify\\n', 'minus five here. What did I do? What am\\n', \"I missing? Never mind. Anyway, I'm just blanking out\\n\", 'on sequence slicing here. So any questions on how\\n', \"to apply operators. Let's move on to\\n\", 'the next question. So how do you perform\\n', 'operations like and and or? The next one is going to\\n', 'introduce and operator and also less than equal to and greater\\n', 'than equal to operators. Find all the trips that\\n', 'have duration between 200 and 4,000 taken\\n', \"by gender one. Why don't you all take\\n\", 'a minute and go back to the original collection display that we had and figure out\\n', \"the relevant field names. I'm also going to do\\n\", 'the exact same thing, but, give it a shot time\\n', \"to solve this question. So for less than or equal to, you're going to have to use $LT, and for greater than\\n\", \"or equal to two, you're going to have to use GT. I'm going to start typing\\n\", \"the initial method call, and then I'll start\\n\", 'talking about the individual options here. So we have the trip stable, so db.trips.find\\n', 'open parentheses, close parentheses, and I\\n', 'need to specify my query. I have two things trip duration. The field name is\\n', 'trip duration itself, and I want to\\n', 'specify a condition. So let me just for now, type in open curly braces,\\n', 'close curly braces. The next field that I want\\n', \"to do the filter based on is gender 1, that's easier. So gender:1, two different\\n\", \"conditions over here. So for the trip duration, that's where you\\n\", 'need to apply the and the greater than or equal\\n', 'to and less than equal to. One wonderful thing is\\n', \"that you don't have to explicitly type and if you\\n\", 'have multiple conditions, if you just separate\\n', 'them by a comma and automatically gets applied. So I can just simply say, my first condition\\n', 'here is going to be less than or equal to, and then less than\\n', 'equal to of actually, let me do greater than\\n', 'equal to because 200-4,000, greater than equal\\n', 'to, and then 200. And then the next condition\\n', 'here is going to be less than or equal to LTE, and then I need\\n', 'to specify 4,000. So and automatically\\n', 'gets applied in between these two conditions by default unless and\\n', 'until you want an or, which will solve using\\n', 'the next question. So let me save the cursor into\\n', \"a variable called cursor, and then I'm going to\\n\", 'convert that into a list. >> Give me a second and\\n', \"then let's take a look at the top three results over here. Hopefully, that should\\n\", 'get you started on how to apply AND-like inequality\\n', 'conditions over here. Now, how do we specify OR? Find all inspections that either occurred in Manhattan\\n', \"OR Brooklyn. Unfortunately, unlike AND, you're going to\\n\", \"have to explicitly specify that you're\\n\", \"applying an OR condition.

I need the OR operator here; \"$or\": and then I\\'m\\n', 'going to have to specify whatever I want to\\n', 'apply the OR to as a list of things and\\n', 'the things inside need to be the field\\n', 'value pair separation. So I need at least\\n', 'two such things. So here is the catch though. This is a trips output. Let me go back up to show\\n', 'you some inspection output. So where is the city\\n', 'information coming from? It is not coming from\\n', 'the original field value pairs because the\\n', 'city information is inside a dictionary which is the value associated\\n', 'with the field address.

Hopefully, that should give you Brooklyn and Manhattan\\n', 'inspections. Brooklyn and Manhattan are\\n', 'technically not cities.

Any questions on how to\\n\", \"specify comparison operators? Let's move on to\\n\", \"the next up here. Again, the documentation link here does not do much because I've literally copy pasted the entire\\n\", \"documentation out here. So I'm not going to go through\\n\", 'an individual example for each of the comparison operators that are listed over here, but I expect that\\n', 'all of you should be able to use each\\n', 'of these operators to be able to answer\\n', 'a question both on a quiz/exam and also\\n', \"on your project. Let's move on to learning\\n\", \"about methods that can be invoked on the fine method. So let me actually go back to the documentation link here. Just give me one second. I'm going to scroll back up. So if you scroll up here and then if you keep scrolling down, you should be able to find more details about the\\n\", 'fine method itself and any of the associated\\n', 'additional methods that can be invoked\\n', 'on the fine method. So you can just use that as an initial documentation\\n', 'to be able to find more information about the other associated\\n', \"methods. Wrong window. So limit is one such method. So we've learned how\\n\", 'to write APA calls to work with MongoDB database which are equivalent\\n', \"to the SELECT clause, FROM clause and WHERE clause. Let's learn about the\\n\", \"LIMIT clause next. That's why we have LIMIT as the next thing\\n\", \"that is written down there. Find the first five trips. So it's going to\\n\", 'be db.trips.find, and that will give\\n', 'you all of the trips on the result which is a\\n', 'cursor object instance.

This will give you\\n', 'the first five trips. Hopefully, nobody should\\n', 'have any questions on the limit() method quite straightforward just like\\n', 'the limit clause in SQL. Now, one other thing. We have the ORDER BY clause in SQL which is going\\n', 'to enable us to sort the resultant rows using a particular columns ascending\\n', 'or descending order. Similar to that, you have the\\n', 'sort() method which can be invoked on the result\\n', 'of the find() method. It can again take\\n', 'that cursor and do the sorting process for you.

So for solving this question, I'm also going to introduce\\n\", 'the regex operator. So let me briefly talk\\n', 'about the regex operator. So if you have no familiarity at all with respect to regular\\n', 'expressions; first of all, regex is short form for\\n', 'regular expressions, I urge you to spend at\\n', 'least 15-20 minutes teaching yourself how\\n', 'regular expressions work.

That said, let's first\\n\", \"cover the examples and I'll answer any questions that\\n\", 'people come up with. So I already mentioned that the sort() method is\\n', 'equivalent to the order by().

Let me rerun the\\n', 'initial few slides. Hopefully, I have the\\n', 'right docker container. Me scroll all the way down here. Before I move on to lag and lead functions.\\n', 'Let me ask all of you. I felt like we rushed\\n', 'the example for range between interval and day preceding and interval\\n', 'and day following. At the end of the last lecture. Do any of you have\\n', 'any questions on how this particular\\n', \"window function works? Or not window function, window frame definition works? We're going to move\\n\", 'on to the last couple of window function options, which are lag and lead. So we saw at the end of the previous lecture that we have a bunch of options with respect to being able\\n', 'to specify window frames. That is, you can do rows\\n', 'unbounded proceeding, and you can also do rows between one proceeding\\n', 'and one following. Of course, this number one here could be\\n', 'changed in order to be able to fit your window\\n', 'frame however you want to. And you could also specify\\n', 'window frame based on days interval that\\n', 'can be computed using any column that has datetime\\n', \"or timestamp types. Let's talk about\\n\", 'lag and lead now. What do lag and lead\\n', 'allow you to perform? Lag allows you to\\n', 'access the data from one row before the current row that is within the\\n', 'same result set. Lead does the opposite, it allows you to\\n', 'access data from the subsequent row with\\n', \"respect to the current row. Let's answer a couple\\n\", 'of questions over here, which will require you\\n', 'to use LAG and LEAD. What is the number of\\n', 'votes for each title compared to the previous title\\n', 'released in the same year. So clearly, we need to be able to join information\\n', \"from two different tables, the title basics table, and the title ratings table because that's where the vote information is\\n\", \"going to come from? Let's do a quick select\\n\", \"query on both of those. I'm just going to do select\\n\", 'star from title_basics. Limit 2. And let make copy paste\\n', 'this query and change that to title_ ratings. Just give me one second. So clearly, we need the start year information\\n', 'other than the title itself, and we also need the number\\n', 'of numVotes column over here. So let me start\\n', \"typing the query. I'm going to directly type the query that solves\\n\", \"the original question. So let's retrieve tconst. I'm going to use the\\n\", \"same abbreviation as I've used before B for\\n\", \"title basic table. Let's also retrieve\\n\", 'the primary title. And, of course, we need the start year\\n', \"because that's what we're going to use to\\n\", 'apply the lag over here. And the fourth thing\\n', \"that I'm going to retrieve is going to be\\n\", \"the numVotes column. That's another part of\\n\", 'the LAG requirement here. What we are going to compute is the number of votes for every title compared\\n', 'to the number of votes compare it to the number of votes from the previous title\\n', \"within the same year. So after this, I'm going to\\n\", 'specify my window function. My window function here\\n', 'is going to be LAG, and LAG should be specified with what column that you want\\n', \"to apply the LAG for. In this case, that's going to be numVotes column from the\\n\", \"title rating stable. So I'm going to say\\n\", 'LAG(r.numVotes). Again, you need the over clause, as with any other\\n', 'window function. I am going to have to\\n', 'do a partition now. What should my partition be? We want to be able to compare the titles released\\n', 'within the same year. So clearly, I need to\\n', \"partition by startYear column. So I'll have to say b.startYear. And let me also do an\\n\", 'order by b.startYear. And the from clause is going\\n', 'to be one of those tables. Let me start with\\n', 'title_basicstable. And I will have to do a join\\n', 'with the title_ratingstable. And the join condition is the exact same thing\\n', \"that we've been typing for a long time now, tconst being the same. So, I am going to show\\n\", 'you one difference here. Should you require an order by clause for the query over here, given that you\\n', 'already are enforcing an order by clause within\\n', 'your window function. For now, let me just type\\n', \"this order by clause. And let's take a look at\\n\", \"the output over here. Let's skip all the NA values. Clearly, these titles are the only titles from\\n\", \"that particular year. So let's scroll all\\n\", 'the way down here and take a look at\\n', 'the last few rows. So for 2024, your first\\n', 'title had numVotes of seven. So for the very first title, your lag calculation is going\\n', 'to be null because there are no prior titles to do\\n', 'the calculation based on. And for the second\\n', \"title in 2024, you're going to end up with the value from the previous row. That is the previous movie, received seven votes\\n\", 'from the same year. And then this is just a\\n', 'simplistic, query here. To be honest, if you really want to apply lag to a scenario, there should be some scenario\\n', 'where you want to be able to compare the current rows numVotes column that\\n', 'the numVotes column in the previous row or\\n', 'subsequent row, and so on. So now, let me show\\n', 'you one thing. Is this order by\\n', \"clause required? So I'm going over this based on feedback\\n\", 'from one of the students, thanks to that\\n', \"particular student. So since we're\\n\", 'mentioning the order by clause within the window\\n', \"function computation, you don't quite actually\\n\", 'need to mention order by clause within the\\n', 'original SQL query. The order by clause within the window function computation automatically gets applied\\n', 'to the result retrieval. So both of those\\n', 'queries will give you the exact same result. Just wanted to offer a\\n', \"clarification on that. Any questions on how LAG works? So, I didn't quite introduce the term common table\\n\", \"expression yet. At least we haven't covered\\n\", 'an example for that. Let me just use this question to show you how to do something with common\\n', 'table expressions. Common table expressions\\n', 'are nothing but temporary results that you can reference within a SQL query. And you can define a\\n', 'common table expression, otherwise known as CTE, using the WITH clause. And CTEs are only visible\\n', 'to the SQL statement that immediately follows the\\n', 'CTE expression itself. What are the benefits? You can have modularity,\\n', 'reusability, and also readability\\n', 'for your query. All of these features\\n', 'should remind you of something else\\n', 'that we have covered. Can someone volunteer and tell me what CTEs are\\n', 'very similar to? What do CTEs remind\\n', 'you of? Yeah. >> Sub queries. >> Sub queries.\\n', 'Excellent. So CTEs can be used as opposed to\\n', \"using a sub query. They're both like replaceable. They have similar benefits\\n\", 'and applications. So the only difference\\n', \"between a CTE and a sub query is that you're actually taking the\\n\", 'sub query part, putting it outside on top of the query that can be considered\\n', 'as the contained query. It just makes CTE a\\n', 'little bit more readable, mainly when you have a lot of depth when it comes to\\n', 'writing recursive queries. Imagine writing a\\n', 'contained query that has like 5-6\\n', \"levels of sub queries. At some point, you're going\\n\", 'to get lost within that. So using a CTE instead of using sub queries\\n', 'would be helpful when you have very deep levels of recursion when it comes\\n', \"to solving problems. So let's take this exact\\n\", 'same query from before. What if I did not\\n', 'want to see all of the rows that\\n', \"have NA values here? So I'm just going to copy\\n\", 'paste this query and change that into a CTE. So the very first thing that I need to type is the WITH clause, and I need to pick\\n', 'a name for the CTE. Let me name the CTE as vote CTE, and I need to use\\n', 'the AS clause and the entire query itself should be within a pair of parentheses. I will tab intent shortly. Before that let me finish\\n', 'typing the parentheses. My query is not complete yet. This is my CTE. You cannot leave a CTE hanging. On top of the CTE, you need to write a query which behaves similar to how a\\n', 'contained query behaves. For instance, I\\n', 'want to be able to filter out all of the\\n', \"rows that have NA values. Actually, before I do that, give me a second, I'm going to go to the\\n\", 'completed version of the notebook file and confirm what name I used previous votes. So let me just save the LAG computation\\n', 'as previous votes, and my contained query is\\n', 'going to be select star from, and the table name is going to be common table\\n', 'expression, my CTE. Instead of mentioning any of the original database\\n', \"table names, you're going to mention\\n\", 'the CTE name here. And I want to be able to\\n', \"apply a WHERE clause here. So I'm going to say WHERE and\\n\", 'previous votes is not null. So this is not great for the 2024 for a second row\\n', \"because you quite can't see the first row\\n\", 'because the first row gets dropped because of the\\n', 'WHERE clause over here. But just an example with CTE. Any questions on LAG or\\n', 'CTE? Yeah, question. >> Why just click on just\\n', \"creating an [inaudible] >> So you're saying like just instead of using the VET\\n\", \"clause, you're going to. Can you explain\\n\", \"your syntax so that I'm familiar with\\n\", \"what you're saying? >> I don't really understand the fact that we're using CTE instead of just\\n\", \"using it [inaudible] >> Yes, you can store. So here's the thing. CTEs are like temporary table. So if you store the result of a table into somewhere else, like, for instance\\n\", 'a view and use it, that is exactly\\n', \"like doing a CTE. Excepting that you're storing the temporary variable\\n\", 'into a permanent thing. Does it make sense?\\n', \"So another thing is can't you write a WHERE\\n\", 'clause in the previous query? Does anyone want to answer\\n', 'that question? Will it work? Can I write the WHERE clause\\n', 'into the previous query? Will it work or will\\n', 'it not work? And why? Does anyone remember the order of computation constraint here? Recall that you cannot apply a condition on a computed column using a WHERE clause.\\n', \"That's not possible. Why? WHERE clause gets executed before the\\n\", 'SELECT clause does. So which means that\\n', 'this computation of previous votes column\\n', \"wouldn't even have happened, then you execute the corresponding WHERE\\n\", 'clause that will throw an error or actually if you write a WHERE clause in there. So because of that,\\n', 'this either needs to be a sub query or it\\n', 'needs to be a CTE. Since all of you guys\\n', 'are very familiar with sub queries and I wanted\\n', \"to introduce CTEs, that's why we're doing CTEs. Any other questions? One\\n\", 'more question. Yeah. >> So is any like technical difference\\n', 'between this and [inaudible] >> Technical\\n', \"difference. By that, if you're talking about, whether it will be different internally with respect to execution\\n\", 'performance, I am not going to talk about the specifics of\\n', 'that because we never quite like covered\\n', 'how exactly internals of database execution works. Again, 564 would be the best course for you\\n', 'to consider if you really want to understand how the\\n', 'database engine itself works. That said, in terms\\n', 'of other than like query optimization\\n', 'and things like that, taking a slightly\\n', \"higher level view where you're talking about sub\\n\", 'queries also producing a temporary table\\n', 'results and CTEs also producing a temporary table\\n', \"result, they're equaling. The fair advantage with CTE is modularity and readability. It looks better when you collapse your\\n\", 'individual subqueries into a CTE and then you can keep going with\\n', 'respect to using one or more CTE with your\\n', \"query. Yeah, question. >> If you use having the CTE, like moving that [inaudible] >> Let's try that. I don't\\n\", \"believe it will work. Let's give it a shot. I'm going to copy the query from the previous table to\\n\", \"be able to answer that. So let's give this a shot. Your question is having, and then previous\\n\", \"votes is not null. Let's take a look at the error\\n\", 'here. Here is the thing. Unknown column previous votes in HAVING clause.\\n', \"Give me a second. It's going to come in handy\\n\", 'that I actually opened Jupyter Notebook one\\n', 'parent level directory up. Somebody was asking\\n', 'me a question about this during a prior lecture.

Actually, you can go\\n', 'one level up and launch it from the lec directory that way you have\\n', 'access to all of the lecture code that\\n', \"will come in handy. So let's go a couple\\n\", 'of lectures back here. Hopefully, this is the\\n', 'right one. Let me see. Query execution\\n', \"order. It's not here. I was trying to go\\n\", 'back to the diagram that we used to discuss. Could be SQL four. Just\\n', \"give me one second. SQL three. That's\\n\", \"what I'm looking for. Seriously. I don't seem to\\n\", 'be able to find the diagram. Anyway, going back to here. So here is again a\\n', 'potential problem. We were discussing when exactly SELECT clause\\n', 'gets executed in the diagrammatic flow of\\n', 'execution of individual clauses. Part of the selection\\n', \"happens when you execute your group by column. In this case, that's a partition by because we have\\n\", 'a vendor function.

So that said, if you don't know\\n\", 'full details of exactly which part of SELECT\\n', 'clause gets executed then, this is going to be a\\n', \"matter of trial and error. Unfortunately, you're\\n\", 'going to have to try whether HAVING clause works\\n', \"and then figure out that, that won't work\\n\", \"I'll have to write a contained query instead. Yeah. >> For my sanity for\\n\", \"the LAG column you don't have that as\\n\", 'previous votes. >> Yes. Good point.\\n', 'There you go. The error is different but then you will still\\n', 'get an error. Yeah. Good question. Any other question? So, let me move on to\\n', 'the next question. Which is going to give you\\n', 'an example with a LEAD. This question is exactly\\n', \"like the previous question, excepting that you'll\\n\", \"have to answer it with a LEAD instead of LAG, because you've been asked to do a comparison between\\n\", 'number of votes for each title compared to the next title within\\n', 'the same year.

We will probably spend like\\n', 'half a lecture talking about other implementations\\n', \"of no SQL databases, but for now, let's\\n\", 'just focus on MongoDB. I have a bunch of learning\\n', 'objectives for you. Before we move on to talking about non relational databases, I want all of you to be\\n', 'able to understand what is meant by transactions\\n', \"and its properties. And we're going to talk\\n\", 'about how to recognize SQL transaction\\n', \"control commands. Then we'll move on to non\\n\", 'relational databases, talk about the\\n', 'differences between relational and non\\n', \"relational databases, and then we'll\\n\", 'move on to be able to identify correct structure and syntax used in\\n', 'specifically document model, which is the data storage\\n', \"model associated with MongoDB. Then we'll define what is meant by a collection and\\n\", 'also be able to differentiate the concepts of\\n', \"linking and embedding data. Let's get started by defining what exactly is a transaction. Transaction is nothing but a mechanism for you to be\\n\", 'able to group a bunch of SQL statements which\\n', 'are all related together or which all\\n', 'should be related together in such a manner\\n', 'that either all of the SQL statements get\\n', 'executed or none get executed. This is typically referred to as all or nothing principle. Why are transactions critical? They enable you to maintain\\n', 'integrity of your databases, the guarantee that\\n', 'you offer in terms of the ACID properties, otherwise known as ACID\\n', \"principle as well. A, in ACID stands for atomicity, C stands for consistency, I stands for isolation, and D stands for durability. Now, let's dive into atomicity. I'm going to define\\n\", 'each of these terms and provide you an\\n', \"example so that it's very easy for you to understand\\n\", 'what each term signifies. Atomicity is the property that ensures that all or no\\n', 'operations get executed. That is the all or\\n', 'nothing principle. That is it ensures that a\\n', 'transaction either gets completely executed or it\\n', \"doesn't get executed at all. No part of the transaction\\n\", 'gets executed. Even if a single operation\\n', \"fails within a transaction, you're going to do an\\n\", \"abort and do a rollback, and we'll talk\\n\", 'about the abort and the rollback terms shortly. The most simplistic example for defining atomicity is going\\n', \"to be a banking transaction. Let's consider that there are\\n\", 'two accounts that you hold, and you have an account\\n', \"A and account B, you're transferring some amount x from account A to account B. Let's say that money direction\\n\", 'from account A succeeds, but money deposit\\n', \"into account B fail. You're most likely\\n\", 'not going to be happy with the situation if this transaction\\n', \"actually goes through because you're\\n\", 'literally losing money. So this is how the all or nothing\\n', 'principle is going to work. Your transaction either should completely execute or it\\n', 'should be rolled back. That is, if you did execute\\n', 'part of your transaction, that is, given that your money deduction\\n', 'actually succeeds, you expect the database\\n', 'whichever is being used by the banking system\\n', \"to give you back that money so that you actually don't end\\n\", \"up losing money. So that's atomicity. Consistency. Consistency ensures\\n\", 'that a transaction takes the database stable from one valid state to\\n', \"another valid state. That is, you're going to ensure that constraints like\\n\", 'primary key, foreign key, unique constraints or like null and not null or\\n', 'negative value constraints must be maintained after a\\n', \"transaction is successful. So once again, let's take into consideration\\n\", 'banking constraints. Probably, like all of you\\n', 'are aware of the fact that your bank account balance\\n', 'cannot be negative. At least the traditional\\n', \"bank accounts. So let's say that\\n\", \"you're considering a transfer of $10 from\\n\", 'account A to account B, when A account\\n', 'balance is just $5, you would expect that\\n', 'transaction to fail because accounts cannot\\n', 'have negative balances. Simple constraint with\\n', 'respect to banking data. Isolation, the I in\\n', \"acid is the principle that's going to ensure that transactions operate\\n\", 'independently, otherwise known as in\\n', 'an isolated manner. So changes that are made by one transaction should not\\n', 'be visible to the changes made by the other\\n', 'transaction unless and until the other\\n', 'transaction is committed. Committing is another new term. What exactly is\\n', 'meant by committing? Committing is finalizing\\n', 'a transaction. Once a transaction is committed, the associated changes\\n', \"are going to be made permanent.So That's going to be the durability\\n\", \"part as well. We'll define durability shortly. So to understand isolation,\\n\", \"simplistic banking example, let's say that you and your partner have cards to\\n\", 'the exact same bank account, and both of you, for\\n', 'some unique reason, are trying to withdraw $10 from the exact same amount from two different places at\\n', 'the exact same time. The hope is that only one\\n', 'of you should be able to withdraw given that the\\n', 'account exactly has $10. So that is a really\\n', 'good example of indicating how the isolation\\n', 'property should be enforced. Only if one of the\\n', 'transaction gets committed, the other transaction\\n', 'should even be processed or be considered for processing. The deep part in asset\\n', 'stands for durability. This ensures that once a\\n', 'transaction is committed, all of the changes\\n', 'are made permanent. Immaterial of whether you\\n', \"encounter any crash scenario. Let's say that your machine with the database server\\n\", 'freezes or it crashes. You have a reboard,\\n', 'you should still have any data that has\\n', 'been committed and a majority of the database\\n', 'management systems offer all four asset guarantees. Specifically, relational\\n', 'database management systems always offer the\\n', 'asset guarantees. All four principles are\\n', 'well accounted for. This is what will ensure you are able to maintain integrity\\n', 'of the database. So how exactly does transaction control commands\\n', \"work in MySQL specifically? So we've spoken about various implementations\\n\", 'of relational databases. The implementation\\n', 'that we have been focusing on and using is MySQL. And we also have\\n', 'other implementations like corporate\\n', \"implementation of Oracle, Microsoft, SQL, and so on. So there's a reason\\n\", \"I'm bringing that up, so there are\\n\", 'differences in terms of different database\\n', 'implementations in terms of how exactly transaction\\n', 'commit process works. So in MySQL, unfortunately, your transactions get\\n', 'committed by default. What do I mean by that? Every SQL query that you execute gets committed by default. So by accident, if you end up dropping\\n', 'a table that you had no intention of dropping or\\n', 'deleting all of the rows of the table by skipping a ware clause in your\\n', \"delete SQL query, you're pretty much screwed because you can't\\n\", \"get the data back. That's because auto-commit\\n\", 'in MySQL is on by default. So that would mean that every single SQL query is\\n', 'considered as a transaction. And the minute you\\n', 'execute your SQL query, the transaction is\\n', 'considered committed. So how can you turn it off? You can execute a simple\\n', 'SQL query by saying set auto-commit equal to off\\n', 'instead of turning it on. So what would happen if\\n', \"you set autocommit to off? You're going to have to manually commit your transactions, and you get to decide when\\n\", 'to commit the transaction. That will give you an option to be able to roll\\n', 'back your changes, that would mean that you\\n', \"don't accidentally end up deleting all of the data from\\n\", 'a database table or even, like deleting the\\n', 'entire database itself. So unlike MySQL, Oracle implementation is going to have auto-commit\\n', 'off by default. That would mean that you need to explicitly commit\\n', \"every transaction. So that's going to\\n\", \"be one advantage. If you make a major mistake, it's going to be not that difficult for you to\\n\", \"rollback in Oracle. So let's talk about other\\n\", 'transaction control commands. How do you begin a transaction? You can either use begin\\n', 'or start transaction, which you start a\\n', 'new transaction. How do you commit a transaction? Just to execute commit\\n', \"that's going to save all of the changes that you made during the transaction\\n\", \"since the previous commit. And that's going to\\n\", 'make your row changes permanent and durable\\n', 'once you execute commit. Few other things\\n', 'for you to know, rollback enables you to revert the changes that have been\\n', \"made it since the last commit. Let's say that you\\n\", 'make a huge mistake of deleting a tables content. You can always do a rollback, that will take you back to the previous commit and\\n', 'get all of your data back. Savepoint allows you to specify individual or\\n', 'how do I say this? Check in commit points in\\n', \"between a transaction. If you don't want to roll back until the beginning\\n\", 'of the transaction, savepoint is going\\n', 'to come in handy. It just allows you to set a point in your transaction\\n', 'where you can go back to later using roll back and you have specific syntax\\n', 'for that savepoint, give it a name, and then\\n', \"roll back to savepoint, and you're going to specify\\n\", \"the savepoint name. And once you're done\\n\", 'using a savepoint, you can release the\\n', 'savepoint release savepoint. Any questions at all about transactions or transactional\\n', 'control commands? I know that in Project P2, and all of the examples\\n', \"that we've used so far, we've only operated on\\n\", 'individual queries that require you to look up the data and do some\\n', 'data manipulation. But at the beginning, we covered how exactly you can create schema from scratch and\\n', 'populate a database table. So transactions are going\\n', 'to be super important when you populate your\\n', \"own database tables. Let's switch gears\\n\", 'and move on to talking about\\n', 'non-relational databases. So quick history in terms of where people discovered what? In 1970s, relational databases, that is SQL was developed by\\n', 'a couple of IBM researchers, Raymond Boyce and\\n', 'Donald Chamberlain. They devised SQL as a way to\\n', 'interact with table data, which is highly structured\\n', 'relational data. So that was the focus\\n', \"back then in 1970s. And then let's move on a little\\n\", 'farther in the timeline. Late 1980s, 1989, specifically, the World Wide Web was\\n', 'invented by Tim Berners-Lee. We know that that was\\n', 'the tipping point for a boom in generation\\n', 'of digital data. World Wide Web is what\\n', 'started the ball rolling, and there was a huge need\\n', 'for large data storage, and there was explosion in terms of the amount of data that\\n', 'people had access to. Little forward in the timeline. Late 1990s, Carlo Strozzi discovered the very first\\n', 'non-relational database, now often referred to\\n', 'as NoSQL databases. The very first\\n', 'non-relational database was called as the Strozzi\\n', 'non-relational database. Non-relational\\n', 'databases were meant to help with storage of back\\n', \"then, unstructured data, but now that's considered a semi-structured data\\n\", 'because back then, nobody used to care\\n', 'that much about raw data other than dumping\\n', 'it into the World Wide Web. So the use case scenario here\\n', 'was to mitigate costs and to increase the\\n', 'efficiency in order to be able to process data, which does not have a very\\n', 'clearly defined structure. So what exactly\\n', 'non-relational databases enable us to achieve? Non-relational\\n', 'databases enables us to have support for\\n', 'polymorphic data storage. What do I mean by that? You can have support for both structured and\\n', 'semi-structured data with a NoSQL database. And NoSQL databases offer a lot of flexibility\\n', 'with schema, unlike relational\\n', 'databases which have very strictly controlled\\n', \"schema for individual tables. It's very easy for\\n\", 'you to consider scaling with respect\\n', 'to NoSQL databases. There are actually two\\n', 'categories of scaling. One is referred to\\n', 'as vertical scaling, otherwise known as scaling up. When you end up adding\\n', \"more computing resources. For instance, I've been talking about this\\n\", 'a bunch of times. Our VM currently\\n', 'only has two GB RAM. If we had 10 GB worth of RAM, maybe we could have been able to process the TRIM DB data set. That is referred to\\n', 'as vertical scaling, otherwise known as scaling up. You take one machine and increase its\\n', 'computing resources. What is the alternate option? Scaling out, otherwise known\\n', \"as horizontal scalability. That is, you're going to add more computing machines\\n\", \"to form a cluster. Instead of scaling up, you're going to scale out. So NoSQL implementations enable very easy horizontal\\n\", \"scalability, that is like you're very\\n\", 'easily able to split your data across a\\n', 'cluster of nodes. And as one would expect, NoSQL databases are meant to\\n', 'give you high performance by handling large volumes of semi-structured or\\n', 'structured data, which is very handy for\\n', \"big data analytics. So let's talk about four different\\n\", \"types of NoSQL databases. We've already covered\\n\", 'this a few lectures ago, but I wanted to do a recap and introduce an example\\n', 'for each of those. So the first category is\\n', 'nothing but key-value database, otherwise known as\\n', \"key-value stores. You're going to do a\\n\", 'mapping between some key and one value or a\\n', 'bunch of values. The second option is\\n', 'a graph database, and the third option is a column database and the fourth option is\\n', 'a document database. You have four different\\n', \"options of NoSQL databases. And let's cover an example\\n\", 'for each of these. For key-value database, the structure here is\\n', \"that you're going to have a unique key paired with one\\n\", 'or a collection of values. And the values can\\n', 'be anything from an integer to a string to\\n', 'a large binary object. It could literally be anything. It could even be a file\\n', 'storing a lot of content. The strength with respect\\n', 'to key-value databases is that the data model\\n', 'itself is simplistic, that enables you to structure\\n', 'the data in an EC manner, similar to what you had with\\n', 'the relational databases, excepting that, you still have a little bit more flexibility\\n', 'with schema here. Let me introduce an example\\n', \"of a key-value database. So on the left column over here, let's say that we're\\n\", \"representing the keys. Even though I'm using a\\n\", 'table representation here, your key-value store need\\n', 'not be thought of as table. So as you can see, the value on the right hand side is a\\n', 'collection of values here, which are about\\n', 'individual users. You have information\\n', 'like name, email, age, and the city from which that\\n', 'particular user is part of. So this is an example of a simplicity value\\n', \"database where you're organizing your value\\n\", 'as a dictionary. Hopefully, all of\\n', \"you're familiar with what a Python\\n\", 'dictionary is. Whenever you have a key-value\\n', 'pair representation, you call that particular data\\n', 'structure as a dictionary. Graph database. What does the graph database\\n', \"structure looks like? You're going to be able to specifically capture the\\n\", 'connection between the data. And each element in your database is going\\n', \"to be stored as a node. And the connection between the nodes as they're\\n\", 'usually called, are going to be called a links, which represent the\\n', 'relationship between the nodes. The strength with respect to graph database is that\\n', \"you're able to traverse the connection between\\n\", \"the data pretty rapidly. So let's go through an\\n\", 'example of a graph database. The most commonly used\\n', 'use case scenario for graph database would be to\\n', 'establish social relationship. Any relationship graph that you want to generate based on, however, your entities are\\n', 'related can be thought of as a good skills scenario\\n', 'for graph databases. For instance, you have a\\n', \"bunch of friends here. Let's assume that\\n\", \"they are friends on some social media website, where they're able to\\n\", 'create some posts. Your graph database entities are going to be all of\\n', 'the people here. And the links are going to\\n', 'be the relationship as to what friendship they have or\\n', 'what action they performed, for instance, liking a post or creating\\n', \"a post, and so on. So that's the second\\n\", 'category of NoSQL databases. The third category is going\\n', 'to be the column databases. The structure here\\n', 'is that the data, instead of being stored\\n', 'as a row is now going to be associated with a\\n', 'column-oriented format. The data that you retrieve\\n', 'using key rows is going to get associated with either\\n', \"one or more dynamic columns. That's going to be\\n\", 'the definition here. The key strengths here is\\n', \"that you're able to write highly performant\\n\", 'analytic queries. Recall that analytics are going to focus on\\n', 'column-based calculations. So column data-oriented\\n', 'databases clearly perform well with analytics-related\\n', 'use case scenario. So I have a database example\\n', 'for the column database. These tables will likely look very similar to the SQL tables. So what exactly is the\\n', 'difference between a traditional\\n', 'relational database versus a column database? Here, in this example, even though at first glance, the data will look like\\n', 'relational table format. Then you actually\\n', 'store the data. The data is actually\\n', 'stored within a column format that is you sort the data using column IDs and not any row-based information. Unfortunately, as a human, if you put the table\\n', 'the other way around, it will probably make\\n', \"your brain go crazy, which is why even though it's\\n\", 'a column-based structure, people represent the same data using a row-based\\n', 'format over here. I know that we are\\n', 'at the 210 mark, just give me one second to quickly introduce\\n', \"a document database, and then let's just do top hat so that we don't miss today's lecture\\n\", 'before you walk out. So document database\\n', 'is the fourth example, rather than going\\n', 'through slides on that, let me just make sure that we go through\\n', 'the top hat question, which is actually related\\n', 'to the exact same thing. The question is\\n', 'going to ask you, which one of the\\n', 'following is not an example of a\\n', \"non-relational database? Feel free to walk out whenever you're done answering\\n\", \"the question. I know that I'm already\\n\", \"over the 210 mark. I will see all of you on Friday, we'll wrap up the lecture\\n\", 'slides on Friday.']\n",

Let's continue our discussion on the topic of database\\n\", 'management systems. There was one question which was brought up during\\n', \"my office hour's today. I thought like that's worthwhile for us all to discuss here. Is CSV format considered as structured or\\n\", \"semi-structured? That's a murky area. CSV does have good\\n\", 'structure enforce because you have\\n', 'specific column names, and then hopefully\\n', 'the column types are intuitive from the column names. But can you actually\\n', 'enforce the content of the column to follow a specific type within\\n', \"a CSV file? Not really. That's why it's a\\n\", 'text-based format. But typically, data\\n', 'scientists and computer scientists\\n', 'actually do consider CSV files as structured. And the reasoning for that\\n', 'is intent of the creator of the CSV file is often to create a structured data set and not an unstructured or a\\n', 'semi-structured one. That said, you could quite literally put in whatever\\n', \"you want inside a CSV file. If you're not\\n\", 'following the intent of having a structured\\n', 'format using a CSV file, it will become unstructured\\n', 'data or semi-structured data, depending on what actual\\n', 'content you have in there. Unlike CSV spreadsheets,\\n', \"you'll be able to actually enforce rules with\\n\", 'regards to data types, so we can very confidently say that spreadsheets\\n', 'can be considered as structured data\\n', 'because there is some level of schema\\n', 'enforcement there. And there was also one more question at the end\\n', 'of the previous lecture, which was about, where\\n', 'do vector databases fall within the types of\\n', 'database management systems? Vector databases being\\n', \"a newer concept, they haven't quite agreed on where exactly it should fall. But my sense is that you should typically be associating\\n\", 'vector databases where information is\\n', 'stored in the form of vectors that maybe object oriented version of database management systems\\n', 'or maybe even NoSQL. But nobody has agreed on exactly where to place vector\\n', \"databases yet. So let's do a quick recap of the types of database\\n\", 'management systems. We are going to be\\n', 'focusing the next, two or three lectures on RDBMS stands for relational\\n', 'database management system. The most commonly\\n', 'used version of DBMS, you are going to be\\n', 'dealing with databases, and you have open source\\n', 'implementations like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and\\n', 'then you also have proprietary implementations\\n', 'like Oracle and Microsoft. Then we learned about\\n', 'four different categories of NoSQL database\\n', 'management systems, where the use case is going\\n', \"to be real time applications, big data analytics, and so on. So we're going to focus mainly\\n\", 'on these two categories over the next two\\n', \"and a half weeks. We'll be learning\\n\", \"how to use MySQL, SQL queries, and then we'll move on to\\n\", \"learn about MongoDB. I still haven't made up\\n\", \"my mind if I'm covering one other type of\\n\", \"NoSQL database. Maybe we'll just like\\n\", 'touch on one example. But the topic for Project 3\\n', 'will be based on MongoDB. Other types of database\\n', 'management systems. You have object oriented\\n', 'database management systems where you store the data\\n', 'in the form of objects, both the data and the behavior can be stored within objects. And the use case scenario\\n', 'for that is when you want to do complex data analysis\\n', 'or data modeling, and also multimedia\\n', 'applications. Then you have graph database\\n', 'management systems, where data is stored in the form of nodes and edges\\n', 'within graphs. Typical use case\\n', 'scenario would be recommendation engines or\\n', 'like social networks that you often find within\\n', 'social media websites like Facebook, and so on. So next category is in memory database\\n', 'management systems. When you have very high\\n', 'performance requirement, you want to do everything\\n', \"in a snap of a finger. You don't want to be going to disk to be able to\\n\", 'read your data. Your data will be stored in RAM, otherwise known as random access memory or\\n', 'memory in short. The use case obviously here\\n', 'is going to be something that requires instant\\n', 'response time. Examples would include gaming or high frequency\\n', 'trading, and so on. Typically, when you\\n', 'think of databases, you often associate data being stored in row\\n', 'oriented formats. But Column oriented formats are as common as the row\\n', 'oriented formats, just that, you\\n', \"probably wouldn't have encountered that many examples of column oriented formats. Column database\\n\", 'management systems, the data is stored in\\n', 'columns instead of rows. And the use case scenario\\n', 'for that is typically data warehousing and\\n', 'large scale analytics, otherwise known as\\n', \"big data analytics. So that's another category. Then you have a couple of legacy database\\n\", \"management systems. I'm just mentioning those here just for the sake\\n\", \"of completeness. People don't use these anymore. You can most definitely say that based on the example\\n\", \"names that I've listed, they typically won't be\\n\", 'that easily recognizable. You have the hierarchical DBMS, which is a specialized\\n', 'version of graph DBMS. Instead of a graph,\\n', \"you have a tree, you'll have a starting\\n\", \"point as the root node, and then you'll be storing\\n\", 'data in the form of tree. It used to be used a lot for legacy\\n', 'telecommunication systems, which came mainly from IBM. Then you have\\n', 'another legacy DBMS, which is network based one. Again, this has many\\n', 'to many relationships. There are slight\\n', 'differences between network DBMS and Graph DBMS. Network DBMS used to be used\\n', 'for legacy banking systems. So most of them have moved on to using graph DBMS nowadays. Any questions at all\\n', \"about the types of DBMS? I'm going to do a quick review\\n\", 'of schema because I felt like the organization\\n', 'of the slides was a little mess\\n', \"up plus lecture, so let's do a quick\\n\", 'review. What is schema? Schema is nothing\\n', 'but a blueprint that controls exactly how\\n', \"the data is stored. It's going to tell you what the structure of\\n\", 'the data should be, including things like what is the type of every\\n', 'column of data, assuming that you have\\n', \"a row-based format. And it's also going to\\n\", 'give you other roles like, what are the primary case? What are the foreign case? Can a particular column\\n', \"have null value? Can it have not null values? Can it have default values? It'll also give you\\n\", 'other information like, what indexing based data structures have\\n', 'been implemented, enabling you to perform fast searches and\\n', 'sorting of your data. It will also give you other\\n', 'things like view subset of the data at a high level\\n', 'and also stored procedures, predefined SQL\\n', 'queries for you to be able to retrieve a subset\\n', 'of data to generate a view. So last lecture, we learned about three different\\n', \"abstraction levels with respect to schema. I'll show you examples for\\n\", 'the conceptual schema, the ice known as logical schema, and also an example\\n', \"for external schema. The voice known as, that's the wrong name. Sorry. I have a wrong tag there. I'll fix that as part of\\n\", \"the slide. My apologies. This shouldn't be called\\n\", 'as conceptual schema. There is one more\\n', \"terminology for that, which I'm forgetting right now. So the external schema represents high level\\n\", 'design details. That is, like for any\\n', \"application that's trying to use your database\\n\", 'implementation, what do they have to know? Pretty much, they only\\n', \"need to know the name of the tables and the column names, and they don't\\n\", 'really need to worry about the types of the\\n', 'data stored within particular columns\\n', \"because that's not part of their\\n\", \"responsibility. They're only trying\\n\", 'to use the data to do analytics and some\\n', 'other application. So logical schema,\\n', 'on the other hand, will provide a little\\n', \"bit more detail. By describing the data model, it's going to tell\\n\", 'you the types of the data stored within\\n', 'individual columns. And then one level down is going to be\\n', 'the physical schema, that is, how exactly your data is stored within\\n', 'your disk device? How exactly is it organized? How exactly is it going\\n', 'to be indexed and so on? So I mentioned about row-based data storage versus\\n', \"column-based data storage. Let's learn the\\n\", \"official term for those two types of data storage. One is known as OLTP. Other one is known as OLAP. Let's first learn about OLTP, stands for online\\n\", 'transaction processing. Whenever you hear the\\n', 'term transaction, the first thing that you\\n', \"should think about is, we're talking about\\n\", 'row-based processing. Typical examples\\n', 'of transactions, you have your\\n', \"e-commerce website. You're trying to add some thing that you're trying\\n\", 'to pie onto a cart, and then all that you\\n', 'care about is that particular transaction\\n', 'end-to-end, you want integrity aspects\\n', 'like atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability,\\n', 'otherwise known as ACID satisfaction rules. So OLTP based data storage\\n', 'always needs to satisfy ACID, all four of those principles. So the entire management\\n', 'of your data, and also the processing\\n', 'is going to be typically based on\\n', 'row-based transactions. Examples of transactions will include how do you get\\n', 'your data inserted? How do you update your data? How do you delete your data? Typical things that you can\\n', 'think of whenever you want to order something of any\\n', 'e-commerce website, and other examples\\n', 'other than e-commerce, would be banking\\n', \"systems as well. That's where our\\n\", 'money comes from, and then you can spend the money on an e-commerce website. Hopefully, not all of it. So airline reservation system. Another example, even though\\n', \"you don't use it that often, people still travel\\n\", \"a lot nowadays. So that's OLTP. What is OLAP? Stands for online\\n\", 'analytics processing. Again, the very first thing that should\\n', 'come to your mind, when I mentioned\\n', \"the term analytics should be column-based. Oh, my God, again, typo with the slide. I'll fix it. This\\n\", \"should be column-based. You know what? Let's\\n\", \"fix it right away. I'll fix the published\\n\", 'version later. So this should be\\n', \"column-based, my apologies. So you're talking about managing and processing data\\n\", 'for analytics here. What exactly do I\\n', \"mean by analytics? Often you'd want to\\n\", \"generate statistics. Imagine, data storage from the end of the person who's trying to run\\n\", 'e-commerce website. They would want to\\n', 'know what product is the most popular one. What product is the most\\n', \"often purchased one. Often doesn't\\n\", 'actually correlate. You would think they would\\n', \"correlate, but they don't. People buy random stuff\\n\", \"for some weird reason. So from their perspective, they'd want to keep\\n\", 'track of how do I generate aggregates from all of the information\\n', 'that I have? How can I mine my\\n', 'data in order to be able to come up with good recommendation\\n', 'systems for my users to basically bait them into buying more stuff\\n', \"that they don't need? That's a nice way of putting it. So those have to\\n\", 'do with analytics. Example scenario include business intelligence\\n', 'and data warehousing, that is like all the things\\n', 'that a person or a company hosting an e-commerce or some other business of similar\\n', 'format will need to know. So basically, OLTP is row-based, and OLAP is going\\n', 'to be column-based. Any questions on\\n', 'OLTP versus OLAP? >> Always column-based has more advantage in\\n', 'terms of analytics? >> So column-based databases have a fair advantage\\n', 'in terms of analytics. Because remember,\\n', \"when you have to run an aggregate query, where let's say that\\n\", 'you want to sum up of all the orders placed by a particular user of\\n', \"your e-commerce website, you're going to\\n\", 'have to literally retrieve all of the rows. Row-based databases\\n', 'are typically optimized for retrieving\\n', 'entire content of rows, and not so much in\\n', 'terms of retrieving individual columns for\\n', 'analysis purposes. So if you put the data the other way around oriented\\n', \"the other way around, then you're going to\\n\", 'have a fair advantage. Hopefully, that makes\\n', 'sense. Question. >> The first one\\n', 'is what we have to de schema [inaudible], and second is why are most combinations with\\n', 'schema [inaudible]? >> Sure. Excellent question. So to repeat the question, do we have to define the schema before we do the data\\n', \"storage? The answer is yes. That's why we're talking about database management\\n\", 'systems here. The rule of thumb is that the very first thing\\n', 'that you do is going to be defining the schema before even you enter any\\n', \"data in there. So if you don't want to have a schema tied up\\n\", \"with your data storage, then you're going to focus on some other type of\\n\", 'solution like data lakes, for example, as opposed to even considering solutions\\n', 'like NoSQL. NoSQL will help you with\\n', 'certain level of not having a completely controlled\\n', 'and predefined schema. But if you want full\\n', \"control as to how you're actually wanting to store data and also support for\\n\", \"formats like unstructured, otherwise known as raw data, you're going to have to look for data lakes- based solutions. Any other questions? Question. >> [inaudible]? >> Column store is one of\\n\", 'the implementations of OLAP. You have many such options. You have, like, file format. So for the row-based ones, all of you can come\\n', 'up with an example. Can somebody tell\\n', 'me an example of a file format for\\n', \"row-based data? >> CSV. >> CSV. That's the very first thing\\n\", 'that you can think of. As opposed to that,\\n', \"the column-based ones, so you might not be familiar with what formats are available. You have things like column IO, and then Parque format, you have, many such options. Excellent questions. Let's talk about relational\\n\", 'database management systems, which is the topic\\n', \"for today's lecture. We're running a little bit slow, but that's always okay. It's always good\\n\", \"to have questions, so it's okay to slow down. So for the purpose of\\n\", \"today's lecture demo, and also for the\\n\", \"rest of the slides, we're going to pretend\\n\", \"that we're going to build, we're going to have to\\n\", \"evacuate, unfortunately. So let's do this guys. >> [inaudible]. >> Also, please come\\n\", 'back after the fire. This is a fire drill, not an actual fire, fire drill. >> [inaudible].']\n",
            "['>> Good afternoon, everyone. I hope all of you had\\n', 'a lovely weekend. I took my sons to\\n', \"the Treinen Farm. It's over at Lodi, Wisconsin, about half an\\n\", 'hour drive from here. If any of you are interested\\n', 'in solving puzzles, they have an actual corn maize that you have to solve through. You have to solve it to\\n', 'find pieces of the maps. Every year, they have\\n', 'a new corn maize, so it makes it interesting. Definitely, they\\n', 'had a lovely time. I hope at least some of you will get a chance to try that out, but you would need a car\\n', 'to get you there though. As one would expect, cornfields are typically\\n', \"in the middle of nowhere, so you'd probably need a car. Let's get started\\n\", \"with logistics. Based on what I've seen as\\n\", 'a response to the poll, majority of the students want me to extend Project\\n', \"P1's deadline. So your wish my command. I'm going to take that, and Project P1's deadline is now officially extended to tomorrow. It'll be due on Tuesday, September 17th\\n\", 'instead of being due today Monday, September 16th. So I posted a couple of\\n', 'announcements or notes on Piazza. Please review those. I think majority of your questions should be\\n', 'answered by these two posts. The first one is about\\n', 'general instructions for you to create an SSH key on your VM to be able to push files into your\\n', 'private repository, and also how to make sure that all of your\\n', 'files are in order. You can quite literally create a new cloned copy of your private repository,\\n', 'run autograder.py. That is exactly\\n', 'what the TAs will be doing in order to\\n', 'grade your project.

            "['have student ID, which can be thought of\\n', 'storing textual information. It can be the schema\\n', 'is just a way of modeling how your database\\n', \"is going to look like. So you don't have to\\n\", 'use official data types to represent individual\\n', 'column types. But you can just still\\n', 'throw the types to the application whichever is trying to use your data storage. Examples would be\\n', \"students table, courses table, and let's say enroll table and\\n\", \"professor's table. I'll show you the logical schema for all of those shortly. [NOISE] Before that,\\n\", 'higher level view. One thing you need to know, other than knowing what\\n', 'are all the entities? What are the possible\\n', 'relationships. Typically, they use some kind of data model representation\\n', 'where they draw individual\\n', 'entities as boxes, and then there\\n', 'will be some arrow connecting the\\n', 'relationship between the boxes and the relationship in this example would be\\n', 'students enroll in courses. Professors teach courses, professors belong\\n', 'to departments. You can easily assume that\\n', 'there is another table which stores department\\n', \"level information. So that said, let's now talk about\\n\", 'modeling the logical schema. So again, you need the exact same information\\n', 'as the external schema, but with some\\n', 'additional details. So what are the\\n', \"additional details? Let's go through\\n\", 'actual examples here. I have four different tables, other than the column name and the type of data stored\\n', 'within the column. We also need to establish exactly what the\\n', 'relationship is. Just having an arrow in between the tables is not\\n', 'going to be sufficient enough to provide a\\n', 'logical abstraction of the schema of your database. So there are going to\\n', 'be two main things that you need in order to\\n', 'establish relationships. One, what is the primary key? Primary keys enable you to identify a row of data\\n', 'using a unique identifier. Primary keys are typically\\n', 'one or a set of columns that determine how to uniquely\\n', 'identify your data. So examples of primary keys in our tables would be student ID within\\n', \"the student's table, and then course ID within\\n\", \"the course's table. And let's say the faculty ID within the professor's table. So hopefully, the intent of the primary keys\\n\", 'should be quite clear. You have the other\\n', 'option, which is, how do you specify foreign relationships\\n', \"that's going to happen via foreign keys. What is an example\\n\", \"of a foreign key? Let's say that you have\\n\", 'the enrolled table, which contains student ID, course ID, and grade. None of this\\n', 'information is actually primary information to\\n', 'that particular table. If you think about it, student ID should come\\n', 'from the students table, your course ID should be\\n', \"coming from the courses table. Similarly, let's say that what courses each\\n\", 'professors teach. Again, that particular\\n', 'column information should be coming from\\n', 'the courses table. These are typically referred\\n', 'to as foreign keys, enable you to identify relationship in between\\n', 'two different tables. How do you actually establish the connection between\\n', 'two different tables? Any questions on foreign keys versus primary keys,\\n', \"using this example? We'll cover an actual\\n\", 'example where we create database tables\\n', 'with the relationships. So let me mention a few\\n', 'other things other than the logical schema\\n', 'enabling you to identify how exactly the\\n', 'tables relate to each other, they also enable you to specify\\n', \"column based constraints. For example, let's consider\\n\", 'the professors table, which has four\\n', 'different columns. Faculty ID, name\\n', 'of the professor, course ID, the course that\\n', \"they're currently teaching, and let's say department ID. Department ID and course ID are clearly foreign keys here, whereas faculty ID is going\\n\", 'to be the primary key. So that said, what other\\n', 'constraints can you specify? You can use null and\\n', 'then not null terms. Null in SQL is going to\\n', 'represent empty values. Can a particular column\\n', 'have empty values? And not null is obviously\\n', 'the opposite of that. A column cannot\\n', 'have empty values, and you can quite\\n', 'strictly enforce that by defining schema\\n', 'that corresponds to that. The final thing that I\\n', 'want to mention from the previous lecture is talk\\n', 'about data independence, which is the whole point\\n', 'of using databases. The applications only need to have external view\\n', 'or high level view. They do not need to worry\\n', 'about internally how exactly the data\\n', 'storage is implemented. And the logical\\n', 'data independence here is going to be protecting you from changes to the logical structure of\\n', \"the data, that is, like, people often don't\\n\", 'worry about can we add a new entity\\n', 'or an attribute, attribute to some other\\n', 'the name for the fields, otherwise known as the columns, without having to actually rewrite the entire application. And physical data\\n', 'independence comes from protection at the physical\\n', 'layout changes level, not worrying about exactly where within a disc your data\\n', 'is stored or like, what type of indexing is used. Any questions about relational database\\n', \"management systems at all before we dive into SQL? The slides for today's lecture\\n\", 'are going to be brief. I was planning to spend\\n', \"more time on the remo. Let's see how far we're able to cover few learning objectives. Most of these you might\\n\", 'already be familiar with, but I still need to introduce\\n', \"SQL from the basics. So I'm going to show you how to create tables\\n\", 'that conform to a particular schema and\\n', \"you're going to learn how to differentiate\\n\", \"various SQL data types, and we'll learn how to\\n\", \"insert data into tables, and also we'll learn how to\\n\", 'delete data from tables. Also, how can we drop\\n', \"unwanted tables. Let's learn basic information\\n\", 'about SQL data types first. You have a reading\\n', \"for today's lecture, let me actually go back\\n\", 'to the course website, from a book called Learning SQL. Again, another oraile book, which you should be able to\\n', 'freely access if you have already secured a library card. Feel free to go\\n', \"through that reading. Let's talk about SQL data types to represent character data. So typically, you'll\\n\", 'either have the char or the var char format\\n', \"and you're going to specify the size within\\n\", 'a pair of parentheses. What is the difference\\n', 'between char and var char? Char is going to support\\n', \"fixed length strings. So you'll have the string\\n\", 'padded on the right side, so the string will\\n', \"be on the left, and then you'll have padding\\n\", \"on the right side to fit that particular size and what is the fixed length part here? It's going to be 255 bytes. Unlike that, var char is going to support\\n\", \"variable length strings. So no padding there, you're going to have to fit your character data\\n\", 'within 65,535 bytes. You also have another\\n', 'feature in most of the SQL offerings\\n', \"called as character set. We're not going to\\n\", 'be dealing with character sets this semester, but if at all, you ever have to work with foreign datasets, and you need foreign\\n', \"language support, character set is how you're able to actually create\\n\", 'a data storage for foreign languages which have different character\\n', 'set requirements, and that can either be multi byte character set or a\\n', 'single byte character set, depending on your\\n', \"application scenario. The reading for today's lecture lists a bunch of character sets, if you're curious, just in case, if you want to explore that. So that's to do with the\\n\", 'character types of data. How about storing large\\n', \"content of textual data? We're now going to talk about\\n\", 'different text formats. You have a couple\\n', 'of legacy formats like tiny text in text. Wire these legacy. So recall that var char\\n', 'can actually store a maximum length\\n', 'of 65,535 bytes. So tiny text in the text can be covered\\n', \"using var char itself? You don't quite need\\n\", 'text format for those. If you have much\\n', 'larger size text, you can go for medium text or\\n', 'long text types of columns. Those are going to\\n', 'correspond to a maximum size of 2^24-1 bytes\\n', 'and 2^32-1 bytes. The book actually lists the number corresponding\\n', \"to that particular number. I felt like that's\\n\", 'too much info for us, 2^24 is easier for us\\n', 'to read as opposed to actually telling\\n', 'you what 2^24 is. The next category of data, numeric data types,\\n', 'you have many options, which correspond to tiny int, small int, medium\\n', 'int and big int. And also you have\\n', 'float and double. I have another\\n', 'slide talking about details associated\\n', 'with float and double. So for majority of the\\n', \"numeric data types, you'd be interested in\\n\", 'a couple of things. What is the range for\\n', 'storing signed information? What is the range for storing\\n', \"unsigned information? For example, for tiny int, you'll be able to store\\n\", 'numbers from negative 128-127. As opposed to that, if\\n', \"you consider unsigned, then you're going to be\\n\", \"able to store from 0-255 and then you've been given signed and unsigned\\n\", 'range for small integer, which is slightly larger\\n', 'than tiny integer. I hope by then, all of you\\n', 'have a good grasp of what exactly is the\\n', \"difference between signed range and unsigned range. So for medium int and int, and I've only specified\\n\", 'the unsign range. You can always calculate the signed range from\\n', 'the unsigned range. As you can see, even int\\n', 'is really large to 2^32-1. If you want to store\\n', 'even larger numbers, beg int is going to\\n', 'come to your rescue. You can store up to 2^64-1\\n', 'for the unsigned range. So float and double, often referred to\\n', 'a single precision and double precision floats. Typically are going to be of the size range four and\\n', 'eight bytes correspondingly. With respect to float data\\n', \"type or double data type, you're going to have to\\n\", 'specify a couple of things. What is the precision?\\n', 'What is the scale? So let me define what\\n', 'precision and scale stand for. Precision refers to the total\\n', 'number of allowable digits, both on the left\\n', 'hand side and on the right hand side\\n', 'of the decimal point. As opposed to that,\\n', 'what is scale? The number of\\n', 'allowable digits to the right hand side\\n', 'of the decimal point, that is the decimal part\\n', \"and not the whole part. So typically, you're going to mention what is the\\n\", 'precision and what is the scale that you want a particular column formatted\\n', 'with and as I mentioned, float will be typically storing four bytes\\n', 'of data and double will be storing typically\\n', 'eight bytes of data. And then you have other\\n', \"temporal data formats. I'm not going to go into\\n\", \"too much details of these. We'll cover them as\\n\", 'and when we need them. You have the date format\\n', \"where you're able to specify you're using four\\n\", 'digit representation, and then two digit month, and then two digit date. You have both date time and time stamp representation\\n', 'for representing your date with time. And then you have year\\n', 'only and then time only options for representing\\n', \"your data question. >> [inaudible] >> So it depends on the application that you're\\n\", \"trying to write. Let's actually put\\n\", \"a pen on that and we'll discuss that at the\\n\", 'beginning of next lecture. I really want to get\\n', \"started with the demo. We'll come back to that question at the beginning of\\n\", \"the next lecture. So let's go through demo. So just like two\\n\", \"commands into the demo. I'm going to bring up\\n\", \"the top hat question, which is why I don't want to spend time\\n\", 'answering your question. I want to go through top hat.

If at all, we can\\n', 'consider Canvas complex, given the number\\n', 'of bugs that they have and the number\\n', 'of enrolls that professors do every semester at the things that\\n', \"Canvas don't offer. So we're going to talk\\n\", \"about something simplistic. Let's just say that we\\n\", 'are trying to build a learning management\\n', 'system to manage courses. You have two terminologies that are going to be\\n', 'thrown at you often. What are the entities? What are the relationships? Entities are typically going to be the tables which\\n', \"store the information. For example, you'll\\n\", 'probably need a table to store\\n', 'students information, courses information, professors\\n', 'information, and so on. And what are relationships? How do those tables\\n', 'relate to each other? Who enrolls to what? Which professor teaches\\n', \"what and so on. So let's go through this example coming up with external schema for this particular\\n\", 'example scenario. The external schema enables\\n', 'you to have views and example for LMS would be for you to have tables of data where you\\n', 'have individual information, for example, all the\\n', \"student information, let's say that you\\n\"]\n",
            "[\"I'm presenting slides. So, what exactly are\\n\", 'window functions? Window functions are\\n', 'special types of functions that enable\\n', 'you to perform specific calculations across\\n', 'a specific subset of rows. So, when we talk\\n', 'about subset of rows, there should be another clause\\n', 'that comes to your mind, which is the group by clause. Group by clause enables\\n', 'you to form subset of rows based on unique value\\n', \"of a particular column. What if that's not how you\\n\", 'wanted to do the grouping? What if you wanted to control how exactly the\\n', \"grouping is done? That's where window functions are going to come into play. So you are going to\\n\", 'calculate some form of statistic for your current row\\n', 'in relation to other rows, the other rows get to be\\n', 'defined by you when you have various mechanisms to be able to define what a window looks like. Unlike aggregate functions,\\n', 'window functions do not collapse the subset of\\n', 'rows into a single row. Recall that when you have an aggregate function along\\n', \"with a group by clause, you run a SQL query, you'll end up with\\n\", 'exactly the same number of rows as the number of unique values corresponding to the grouped column or\\n', 'grouped set of columns. Unlike that, your\\n', 'window functions do not collapse the\\n', \"resultant rows. Instead you're going\\n\", 'to end up with a single row corresponding to each of the original\\n', \"database table row. So let's talk about the clauses that you need to\\n\", 'learn in order to understand how to use\\n', 'window functions. You have three main clauses, which is the over clause, order by clause, and partition by clause. The order by clause\\n', 'here is not the same as the order by that you have in the original SQL query. Rather, it is an order by clause associated\\n', 'with the over clause. What exactly is an overclose? Over clause is how you define the window or the partition\\n', 'can also be called as partition over which you want whatever function\\n', 'to be applied. And order by is going to enable you to specify the\\n', 'order of the rows inside the window or the partition in order to perform your statistic\\n', 'calculation. Partition by, what does that do? Partition by is going to be\\n', \"very similar to group by. It's going to divide the original database table rows into individual partitions. The key difference between\\n\", 'group by and partition by, partition by does not\\n', 'collapse the rows. You still are going to have\\n', 'all of the original rows in the database table instead of having one summarized row. So, the easiest way for you to understand\\n', 'window functions would be by using ranking\\n', 'functions as examples, because ranking is going to be a natural use case that you can apply to many database tables. You have three\\n', 'ranking functions. Let me just give\\n', \"you an overview, and then we'll cover examples\\n\", \"of each of these functions. You have rank, which is what you're going to be dominantly using for solving\\n\", 'Q31 through 35, rank returns the same ranking\\n', \"whenever you have a tie, you're going to perform\\n\", 'the ranking based on some particular\\n', 'columns ordering, which is why the over clause is associated with an\\n', 'order by clause. So what happens when you\\n', 'actually encounter a tie? The tie is going to\\n', 'lead you to have the same rank for all of\\n', 'those rows that have the tie. And then, in order to\\n', 'handle the gap in the rank, cost by the thigh, rank function is going to\\n', \"literally produce a gap there. What do I mean by that? I'll\\n\", 'show you an example shortly. So first of all, to\\n', \"explain what a gap is. Let's say that you have\\n\", 'three rows with rank 1. The next row, which is\\n', \"supposed to be of rank 2, is not going to have rank 2. Instead, it's going to skip\\n\", 'over the two tied up rows. So that will have rank number 2, because rank number 2 and 3\\n', \"got tied up inside rank 1. That's what it means by ranking width gaps\\n\", \"in the rankings. And let's cover that\\n\", 'with an example. And then after that,\\n', \"I'll talk about dense rank row number\\n\", \"functions. Here's the question. Rank all of the title IDs by their ratings in\\n\", \"descending order. Just give me once again, I'm going to sync up\\n\", \"my notes over here. First of all, let's do select\\n\", \"star from title ratings. Clearly, we're interested in title_rating table data here. You've been asked to rank all the title IDs\\n\", \"by their rating. Where do window functions go? They're going to go as\\n\", 'part of the select clause. So, let me extract\\n', 'the title IDs here, which is given by\\n', 'the tconst column, and then let me also take the average rating and put\\n', 'it out there as part of the select clause list\\n', 'of columns that we have selected\\n', \"because we're going to do the ranking based\\n\", \"on the average rating. So I'd like to have average\\n\", 'rating displayed as well. So, how do you how do you\\n', \"type a window function? You're going to\\n\", 'specify whatever, function you want to\\n', \"apply over your window. That's going to be\\n\", \"the first thing. And then you're going to specify the over clause within\\n\", \"a pair of parentheses, you're going to control\\n\", \"how you're going to order the rows\\n\", 'within your window. So the window function\\n', 'that I want to apply here is the rank function. So I need to specify rank open parentheses,\\n', 'close parentheses. This is the name of\\n', \"the window function. Then followed by that, I'm going to specify the over clause. And how do I want\\n\", 'my ordering to be? I want descending order of\\n', \"the average rating column. So I'm going to say order by average rating\\n\", 'and then descending. Let me store the rank that is getting produced by\\n', 'the rank function as a column name title rank. So let me go ahead\\n', 'and execute this and in order to demonstrate\\n', \"how ranking with gaps work, I'm just going to add\\n\", 'a limit clause so that we can talk about how\\n', 'exactly gaps work. As you see, there is exactly\\n', 'one title with rank 1. So the next title with the next lower average rating\\n', \"is going to receive rank 2. Notice that you don't have\\n\", 'any ties up until rank 4. But when it comes to rank 4, you have three\\n', 'different titles that have average rating as 9.5. All three of those are going to receive four as their rank. Because you had three of them, you are going to\\n', 'skip over rank 5, skip over rank 6, and the next one is\\n', \"going to become rank 7. Any questions on how rank works? Let's move on to\\n\", 'the next question. What good is ranking\\n', \"for us if we can't actually access the title\\n\", \"associated with the ID? We're only able to\\n\", 'see the ID here. So in order to solve\\n', \"the next question, I'm going to literally\\n\", \"copy paste this query. And let's include joints here. Let's retrieve the name\\n\", 'of the title as well. Name of the title needs to\\n', 'come from title basics, so which means that I need\\n', 'to have a join clause. So I need to have\\n', 'title basics as the other table that I\\n', 'want to do the join with. And then my own clause\\n', 'here is going to be, let me actually use the naming here as R for title ratings\\n', 'and B for title basics, and then I need to say\\n', \"b.tconst = r.tconst, that's going to be\\n\", 'my joint operation. And now I need to explicitly specify one of the\\n', 'sources for my tconst, and then, other than\\n', 'the tconst itself, let me also retrieve the\\n', 'primary title column, which needs to come from\\n', 'the title basic table so that we can actually take a look at the titles along\\n', \"with the associated ranks. That's the first example\\n\", \"with a ranking function. I'm going to scroll\\n\", 'up so that we can talk about the dense rank. What is dense rank to? Dense rank returns the\\n', \"exact same ranking as rank, excepting that it's not going to have gaps within the ranks. It's just going to keep going with incremental\\n\", 'ordering of the rank. Depends on your\\n', 'application scenario. So let me actually copy paste this query from question\\n', \"2 over to question 3. It's asking you to dense rank all titles by their\\n\", 'ratings, descending order. Instead of the\\n', \"function name as rank, you're now going to\\n\", 'just change the name of the window function if I\\n', \"can spell, dense_rank. And that's going to give\\n\", 'you a different ranking. Once again, let me use a limit clause so that we can actually take a look\\n', 'at the output here. As you can see, even though there are ties with\\n', 'rank number 4, the next title is\\n', 'receiving rank number 5. It sort of depends on how exactly you want\\n', 'to rank your data. Any questions on rank\\n', 'versus dense rank? >> You have a third option, which is row number. Row number is going to enable\\n', \"you to assign unique ranks. You'd need this also for solving\\n\", \"one of the P2 questions. It's going to assign unique\\n\", 'rank based on some ordering. So here is a problem. What will happen\\n', 'if there are ties? Unfortunately,\\n', 'row_number is going to arbitrarily assign one\\n', 'rank to one of the rows and another to another\\n', 'row if you do not have an explicit mention\\n', 'of how to break the ties. How do you break the ties? You need to explicitly mention what the\\n', 'ordering requirements are so that you can break the ties in a\\n', 'consistent manner. So the project description does provide sufficient\\n', 'ordering requirements for the question where\\n', \"you've been asked to provide unique ranks. So let me scroll down\\n\", \"here really quickly, and we're going to\\n\", 'answer a question for assigning unique ranks,\\n', 'again, same question. Instead of assigning\\n', \"tied up ranks, you've been asked to\\n\", \"assign sequential ranking to each title again, based on descending order. That's not sufficient enough. That's why you have\\n\", 'this additional statement, which is saying, if there are ties in ratings, break the ties based on\\n', 'ascending order of the titles. So first of all,\\n', 'I need to change the rank function here\\n', 'to row_number function. So let me finish\\n', \"typing that part. That's the name of\\n\", 'your window function. So inside the OVER\\n', 'clause over here. I need to specify ORDERED BY\\n', \"average rating descending. That's the default way that\\n\", \"you're doing the ranking. But you do have an\\n\", 'additional condition being imposed where you want to order the primaryTitle, and the ordering for that\\n', 'should be ascending. You can either explicitly\\n', 'mention ascending or just like leave it as such. So let me run this query. And once again,\\n', \"I'm just going to show you the top 20\\n\", 'rows so that you can take a look at the\\n', 'output title rank here as you can see every row, despite the average rating\\n', 'column having a unique value, gets assigned a new title rank. Now, how does the\\n', 'ranking work in between rows that have\\n', 'the same average rating? They should be ordered based on ascending order of\\n', 'the primaryTitle. So speaking of this, this actually makes me talk about Question 23\\n', 'from Project 2. What is the problem\\n', 'with Question 23? Actually, one of the names\\n', \"of the album column, I think album title. I'm forgetting the exact\\n\", 'name of the column, has a special character, which is, open square bracket. Unfortunately, in SQL, you\\n', 'need to explicitly control how the Alpha numeric\\n', 'ordering goes along with special characters ordering with the lack of what is\\n', 'called discalation. Every database\\n', 'implementation is going to automatically choose one\\n', 'out of the two options, which is like, do you put the\\n', 'special characters in front of the Alpha numeric\\n', 'characters or vice versa? I do not want that\\n', \"inconsistency. Hopefully, we'll be able\\n\", 'to figure out a way for you to write an extension\\n', 'to the ORDER BY clause, which specifies exactly how the collation should\\n', 'happen when there is discrepancy between\\n', 'a special character versus Alpha numeric character. Any questions at all about ranking functions?\\n', 'Yes. Question. >> [inaudible]. >> Sorry. Come on, where? >> So [inaudible]. >> Instead of using\\n', \"row number, what? >> [inaudible]. >> And you're getting the\\n\", \"unique ranks with rank? >> Yeah. >> That is possible. That's because like your\\n\", 'ORDER BY clause is now giving you two different\\n', 'conditions to impose. So his question is, like, he changed the window function to rank here instead\\n', 'of row number, and it produced the exact same\\n', 'result as the row number. That is happening because\\n', 'in the previous example, your rank function only had one columns order that was controlling how\\n', \"the ranking works. Instead of doing that, when you're imposing two\\n\", 'different conditions here, it is possible that\\n', 'rank function could lead you to have unique ranks. It totally depends on the individual columns that\\n', \"you choose for your ordering. As long as you're able to clear auto grader for P2\\n\", 'with just rank for, I believe, Question\\n', \"32, I could be wrong. I'm fine with you using\\n\", \"rank as the solution. Hopefully, I think that's where\\n\", 'you were trying to go to. I am going to change this back to row_number so as\\n', 'to not cause any confusion. Any questions at all about basics of window functions\\n', 'or how ranking works? Yeah. >> In that question that\\n', \"we have [inaudible]. >> Random order. Yeah, that's\\n\", 'correct. It could happen. You could have two\\n', 'different titles from entirely different\\n', 'countries having the exact same title name, and for some weird reason, having exactly same\\n', 'average rating. It could happen. In that\\n', 'case, rating is like, you need to think\\n', 'about other ways of breaking the ties if you\\n', 'want to ensure consistency. Awesome. Excellent questions. The next thing that\\n', 'I want to talk about is we learned how to use the OVER clause and\\n', 'basic window functions. You could write an OVER clause without having a\\n', \"PARTITION BY clause. What does the OVER clause do when you don't have\\n\", 'a PAETITION BY? Pretty much is\\n', \"going to operate on the entire database table. That's your window. Since you wanted to do a global rank of\\n\", \"all of the titles, that's what we did with the\\n\", \"first four questions here. What if that's not\\n\", 'what we want to do. What if we wanted to consider individual groups, for example, genres of titles, and we want to provide ranking\\n', \"within each genre. That's where PARTITION BY is\\n\", \"going to be useful for you. It's going to divide the\\n\", 'result set into subset or partitions based on\\n', 'one or more columns. Exactly like GROUP BY clause, you can have one column\\n', 'or more than one column. Accepting that GRUOP\\n', 'BY clause collapses all of the subset of\\n', 'rows into a single row, and like that, PARTITION BY\\n', \"is not going to collapse, and that's how you\\n\", 'do the ranking with individual partitions. In the typical US\\n', 'case scenarios, ranking within some\\n', \"specific group, let's go ahead and rank all of the titles based\\n\", 'on their rating, descending order\\n', 'within each genre. Once again, this builds up\\n', \"on the previous question, so I'm just going to\\n\", \"copy paste my SQL query, and then I'm going to\\n\", 'keep modifying this. I want to give all of\\n', \"you heads up that right after finishing this query, let's do top hat, so giving you a heads\\n\", 'up so that you can get prepped up for top hat. So rank all titles based on their descending\\n', 'order of rating. Instead of just using the\\n', 'ORDER BY clause here, I now need to specify\\n', 'PARTITION BY clause, PARTITION BY what column, within each genre,\\n', 'whatever the each is, each part of the\\n', 'question is per each, within each,\\n', 'something like that, that will most likely be what you want to associate\\n', 'with PARTITION BY, assuming that your question is testing you on window functions. If not, that would be GROUP BY. PARTITION BY what? I want the genres column\\n', \"that's coming from inside the title basics table, so I'm going to say b.genres. And let me get rid of the other ORDER BY\\n\", \"clause over here. I'm just going to do ORDER BY\\n\", \"average rating, descending. And let's see what\\n\", 'that does. Let me go. I typed in a\\n', \"character by mistake. Let's see what that does. I also needed to select b.genres so that we can\\n\", 'actually talk about the result. Give me a second. What am I missing?\\n', \"I'm missing a comma. So you can skip the genres\\n\", 'null if you want to. I think I do have a WHERE clause in my published notebook. So let me just type in the WHERE clause\\n', 'here by saying where b.genres is not null so that we can skip\\n', 'over the null values. And let me also get rid\\n', 'of the LIMIT clause here. So within all\\n', \"action genre title, you're now going to have unique ranks because I'm\\n\", \"using row number here, you'll get a unique rank. If you're using rank, if there is a tie, then you can have the same\\n\", 'rank for two different rows. And then once you move on\\n', \"to the next partition, which is the next genre, you're going to start over from the first rank\\n\", 'and then assign ranks for individual titles\\n', 'within that particular genre, based on the descending\\n', 'order of average rating. Any questions at\\n', 'all about how to use PARTITION BY with\\n', \"the OVER clause? Let's do top hat. Not surprisingly. The question is about\\n\", 'rank functions. This is on. Looks like\\n', \"I didn't set a timer. My apologies, you'll\\n\", 'probably have more time than to answer the\\n', \"question because of that. But that's ok. I'm\\n\", 'fine with that. As always, please discuss the top questions.\\n', \"There are no roles. Please don't forget to\\n\", 'submit your response. Whatever button there is, please click it so that your\\n', \"response will get recorded. Subjective question. I'll get rid of the\\n\", \"correctness factor for today's lecture. I just realize that the\\n\", 'question is subjective. Both dense rank and row\\n', 'number are correct answers. I cannot believe I did not ask the other way round\\n', \"question. My apologies. That's why you have a split vote from all of you,\\n\", 'which is excellent. All of you have a\\n', 'good understanding. Both dense rank and\\n', 'row number will generate a unique\\n', 'rank without gaps. My apologies. I will fix\\n', 'this after the lecture. The top head auto\\n', 'regrades the question. So you should get\\n', 'your points back if you had answered dense rank. Let me move back to\\n', \"my notebook file. The next thing that we're\\n\", 'going to talk about is how to use aggregate functions\\n', 'with window functions. No matter what subset of\\n', \"rows that you create, whether that's using\\n\", \"GROUP BY clause, or whether that's created\\n\", 'using your window clauses. Whatever it is, you should be able to perform some form of aggregation among all of\\n', 'those rows. Key difference. When you associate aggregation\\n', \"with GROUP BY clause, you're going to end up\\n\", 'with one value exactly. Unlike that with\\n', 'window functions, you can end up having\\n', 'multiple values. Each of them will\\n', 'be associated with individual database table rows. So quick recap, what are\\n', \"aggregate functions? We've learned about\\n\", 'the sum average count min max functions, and you can use any of those\\n', 'with window functions. I believe you have one\\n', 'question in project P2, which requires you to apply aggregate function within\\n', \"a window function. So let's answer\\n\", 'one question here, which is rank all titles by\\n', 'total number of ratings, following the descending\\n', 'order for each title. Again, if there are\\n', 'ties and rating, break ties based on ascending\\n', \"order of the titles. So that's what we're\\n\", \"going to answer next. So let me start typing my query. Let's do select star from title_basics here so that we can take a look at\\n\", 'the columns that we need. You need the total\\n', 'number of ratings, which are probably going to come from your title rating table. So let me do a select star\\n', 'of that table as well. Just give me one second so that I can show you\\n', 'both of these results, and then we can start\\n', 'writing the query. Now that you have both\\n', \"of that information, let's start writing\\n\", 'the actual query. So what do I need? I need to be able to\\n', 'rank all the titles. So let me retrieve the same things that\\n', \"we've been retrieving the title ID primaryTitle. And then, other than that, I need to apply my\\n\", \"aggregate function to the number of rating column. So I'm going to just\\n\", 'sum up the number of votes in order to represent\\n', \"the number of ratings. So I'm going to say\\n\", 'some r and r,numbers. Actually, let me finish typing the JOIN clause over here so that we have\\n', 'both of the tables. Let me do a join\\n', 'with title basics, and ON clause here is going to be the exact\\n', \"same ON clause that we've been writing for a while\\n\", \"now, b.tconst = r.tconst. That's my JOIN clause. I'm missing title, and then I'm missing a comma. What am I missing?\\n\", 'Give me a second. Let me scroll down\\n', 'really quickly. Oh, I need to finish\\n', \"writing my query. I can't really do the summing over here\\n\", \"without my OVER clause. My apologies. Let's finish\\n\", 'typing the OVER clause. And you can rename this as\\n', \"total ratings if you want to. I'm going to mention one thing. Notice that I'm\\n\", 'actually renaming this, but I cannot use this\\n', \"inside my OVER clause. I'll give you the reasoning\\n\", \"for that shortly. Going back to the question, what window function do I need? We're still working with ranks, so I'm going to just\\n\", 'use rank function. And then I need my\\n', 'OVER clause over here. Actually, just give\\n', \"me once again, I'm going to tab in\\n\", \"my SELECT clause so that it's more readable. OVER clause is going to\\n\", 'now specify the ordering. And the ordering is going to come from my aggregate\\n', 'computation, and I want to be imposing descending order of my\\n', \"aggregate computation. That's what the question\\n\", 'is asking you to do. The question here is, can you just say total ratings and then say\\n', \"descending over here? Unfortunately, that's\\n\", \"not going to work. That's because, you\\n\", 'cannot actually control exactly how the selection ordering works inside a\\n', 'query execution plan. So most of the database\\n', 'implementations will complain when you use the renamed column inside the OVER\\n', 'clause over here. Instead, you need to\\n', 'explicitly type out the aggregate function\\n', 'in its full detail. >> A couple of reasons as to\\n', 'why they have the 10 force. One, I already\\n', 'mentioned to you that you cannot really control how exactly the ordering\\n', 'works inside a SELECT clause in terms\\n', 'of retrieving the data. The second reason is, your query might have more than one aggregate\\n', 'function computation. And in order to make\\n', 'absolutely clear which aggregate function\\n', 'computation you want to associate with the ordering\\n', 'of your window function, your database implementations\\n', 'expect you to expand your aggregate\\n', 'function out rather than using the short names that you might have assigned to the\\n', \"aggregate computation. So you're going to have\\n\", 'to explicitly type the aggregate function again. And of course, this\\n', \"time you don't need the S keyword usage, you can just say\\n\", 'ORDERBY some of this, and you need to specify\\n', \"descending order, because that's what the\\n\", 'question is asking you to do. Descending order is going\\n', 'to be how you order, in order to do the\\n', 'primary ranking. And then here is another note. It says, if there\\n', 'are ties in ratings, break the tie based on\\n', 'ascending order of the title, so I need another column name, which is primary\\n', 'title over here, and then ascending order. And let me rename\\n', 'this as titleRanks. And what else do I\\n', \"need here? Let me see. I have my SELECT clause, FROM clause, JOINT clause. And I'm also going to need a GROUPBY clause to be able\\n\", \"to answer this question. Wait, give me a second. I just need to make sure that I'm looking at the\\n\", 'right question here, and not at the wrong solution\\n', 'from my solution here. So the question here is\\n', 'asking you to rank titles based on the total number\\n', 'of ratings for each title. So the GROUPBY clause over here, let me group the information based on the individual\\n', 'title column value, so which is tconst, and also the primary\\n', 'title over here. What am I missing?\\n', 'Oh, give me a second. B.tconst, not t.aconsts. My apologies. So what\\n', \"will this give you? It's going to do the ranking based on\\n\", 'the aggregate function. The aggregate function\\n', 'is computing the sum of the number of votes corresponding to each\\n', 'title over here. And then you hopefully, will have unique ranks\\n', 'or rank with ties. If you want unique ranks, you can change rank\\n', 'to row number here. Any questions on how to use aggregate function\\n', \"inside the OVER clause? Let's move to talking\\n\", \"about window frames. So far, we've spoken about two different ways\\n\", 'of creating windows. One, general window where\\n', 'you consider all of the data by not mentioning\\n', \"any partitioning inside the OVER clause. That's one option for you. Second option was for you to use PARTITIONBY to specify\\n\", 'partitions based on a specific column or group of columns that you want to create the\\n', \"partitions based on. You have another option. What if you don't want to\\n\", 'impose either of those, and you want other ways of controlling how exactly\\n', 'the windows work? You are going to be looking at what are known\\n', 'as WindowFrames, and you have a couple of\\n', \"options for WindowFrames. We're going to start with\\n\", 'something simplistic, which is ROWS\\n', 'UNBOUNDED PRECEDING. What exactly ROWS\\n', 'UNBOUNDED PRECEDING means? Your window is going to\\n', 'include all of the rows from the first row up\\n', 'until the current one. Effectively, it creates\\n', 'what is known as a window for you\\n', 'to produce running total or calculate\\n', 'moving average, whatever you want\\n', 'to compute with the rows that you have\\n', \"encountered so far. So let's answer a question\\n\", 'that requires you to use ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING. First of all, in\\n', \"order to do that, I've already typed\\n\", 'out the SELECT clauses for the relevant tables that you need to\\n', 'answer the question, which is title ratings\\n', 'and title_basics tables. The question here is\\n', 'asking you to calculate cumulative total of votes for\\n', 'each title over the time. And how do you define\\n', \"over the time? Based on the start here. So let's get started with\\n\", \"this SQL query over here. So I'm going to, once again, select a tconst and\\n\", 'primary title column. And then I need start\\n', 'here as well this time. And my FRONT clause, for now, let me have\\n', \"a test title_baics. That's a start. Those are\\n\", \"the columns that we'll probably need in order to do\\n\", 'the calculation over here. What calculation do\\n', 'we need to do here? We want to compute cumulative\\n', 'total of the votes.

So I'm going to mention my\\n\", 'aggregate function over here, which is sum of r.numVotes, and then over what? So the over what\\n', 'part is going to be based on whatever ordering\\n', \"that you want to do. And let's do the ordering based on the start year over here, because we want to be able to sum up all\\n\", \"the number of votes depending on whether you've encountered a title\\n\", 'already or not. So in order to ensure that\\n', \"we have some ordering, let's type out an\\n\", 'ORDERBY clause, and we want to impose the order based on\\n', 'startYear column. And here is where you type how exactly the\\n', 'window gets defined. And the keyword\\n', 'for that is quite, literally, ROWS\\n', 'UNBOUNDED PRECEDING. So let me copy paste that\\n', \"so that I don't make any typos, ROWS\\n\", \"UNBOUNDED PRECEDING. That's how I want to do\\n\", 'the sum computation. This controls how exactly\\n', 'the window gets defined. And other than the\\n', 'title_basics stable, I want to be able to retrieve the information from the\\n', 'title_rating stable as well. So I need a JOINT clause here, title_ratings or once again, the ON clause is exactly\\n', 'the same as before, tconst being the same. And let me also order the entire queries result\\n', 'based on startYear, so that we can\\n', \"actually check whether our computation is correct. What am I missing? I'm most definitely\\n\", 'missing something. Give me a second, I must be missing comma here,\\n', \"after b.startYear. So whenever you're\\n\", \"writing window functions, it's likely that you'll have the window function\\n\", 'in its own line. Most of the time\\n', 'CR error will come from missing comma from\\n', 'the previous line. So to break this down, we are trying to create a\\n', 'cumulative sum of the number of votes based on the window that starts with\\n', \"the beginning row. One thing that you need to know, the very first row, you don't have any\\n\", 'data up until then. So the sum is just\\n', 'going to be all of the info that\\n', \"you already have. So it's just going to come\\n\", 'from that particular row. So in order to show that, let me retrieve the\\n', \"numVotes column. Just give me one second. I'm also going to change this\\n\", \"to, let's say, totalVotes. What am I missing? Again, comma. Let me fix that. So\\n\", 'the very first row, your cumulative sum or your moving average is going to only come from\\n', \"the very first row, because you don't have\\n\", 'any other prior data. But the total\\n', 'number of votes for the second row is going to be the first row summed\\n', 'up with the second, and for the third one, first three values\\n', 'summed up together. Any questions on ROWS\\n', 'UNBOUNDED PRECEDING or how to use it? Very useful way\\n', 'for you to compute moving average or running total. I have two other examples\\n', \"that I want to go over. I'm actually going to talk about the description of rows between one preceding\\n\", 'and one following, after literally typing out a query because\\n', \"it's easy for us to understand the behavior of rows between one preceding\\n\", \"and one following, once we type the query out. So just give me one second. I'm actually going to copy paste the query from the\\n\", \"completed version of the Notebook file Q8. That's what I need.\\n\", \"Give me a second. I'll just walk you through the solution rather than\\n\", \"type the query from start. So it's asking you to calculate the average rating\\n\", 'of each movie, including the ratings of the previous and the next movies, based on the release years. So clearly, the ORDERBY by\\n', 'column within the OVER clause here is going to be dependent\\n', 'on the releaseYear, which is the startYear column, which is coming from\\n', \"the title_basics table. So that's your ordering\\n\", 'imposition here. After doing that, what\\n', 'do you need to specify? Once you order your data, you want to calculate the\\n', 'average rating based on one row above the current row and then one row below\\n', \"the current row. That's exactly what rows between one preceding and\\n\", 'one following means. So one preceding indicates the previous row with\\n', 'respect to the current row, and one following indicates the next row with\\n', 'respect to current row. So if you think about it, you have three rows, Row A, which is the\\n', 'preceding row, Row B, which is the current row, Row C, which is going\\n', 'to be the next row. And then you compute\\n', \"whatever statistic that you want to perform, in this case, we're\\n\", 'computing average of average rating over\\n', 'those three rows. So just to be clear, you once again, need\\n', 'the JOINT clause, because your info is split across two different\\n', 'tables over here. So what happens to\\n', 'rows between one preceding and one following\\n', 'for the very first row? The very first\\n', 'row, you only have two rows as data points, that is, you have\\n', 'the current row, which is Row B, and then\\n', 'you have the next row, which is Row C. You\\n', \"don't have Row A, which means that you're\\n\", 'going to compute average in between these two\\n', 'values, which is 4.75. As opposed to that,\\n', \"if you consider B row as the row with the ID 1, you're going to compute\\n\", 'an average between 5.2, 4.3, and 4.8, which gives you 4.76. Similar to how you ignore\\n', \"Row A for the first row, you'll be ignoring Row\\n\", 'C for the last row. You only have one preceding row, and then the current row, and no subsequent\\n', 'following row from that. Any questions on\\n', 'how rows between one preceding and\\n', 'one following works? Here is the thing. This\\n', 'is all nice and good. What if you wanted more\\n', 'than just the previous row, current row, and the next\\n', \"row to be your window. That's going to be the\\n\", 'final piece of the puzzle, which is range between interval and number of days preceding\\n', 'the interval and interval, n number of days following\\n', 'that particular range. So clearly, this is meant to only work for columns\\n', \"that have type, DATE, DATETIME or TIMESTAMP. Here's the issue with our data. First thing, I'm going to\\n\", 'show you how you can explore the schema of a table without actually using the\\n', \"SELECT* query. So I'm going to introduce\\n\", 'a couple of queries, which are handy whenever\\n', 'you want to directly go for schema information\\n', 'in order to ensure that you have a particular\\n', 'type associated with a column. So how do you actually access\\n', \"database tables schema? You have two different options. You can either use the query, show columns from table name. For example, let's take a look at the\\n\", \"title_basic table schema, show column from, and then followed by which you'll mention the\\n\", 'name of the table. The same thing can also be accessed by using another\\n', 'query called describe, and describe is going to be followed by the\\n', 'name of the table, which is described title basics. Both of those queries produce\\n', \"the exact same result. It's going to give\\n\", 'you a list of fields, which are nothing but columns. The type associated\\n', 'with each column, whether or not you have null enforcement\\n', \"associated with a column, whether it's a primary\\n\", 'key or a foreign key, any other key constraints, what is the default value? Any other extra information\\n', \"about that column. Now, let's explore\\n\", 'the question here. Calculate the total number of\\n', 'votes each movie received, including votes from movies released three days\\n', 'before the current movie, and then three days\\n', \"after the current movie. So that's going to\\n\", \"be interval range. So here's the key problem. StartYear column\\n\", 'is of double type. As I mentioned, you can only use the range between interval. Four columns that have DATE\\n', 'or DATETIME specification. So given the interest of time, and I want to be able to\\n', \"finish this question, so I'm going to show you how to solve this question rather\\n\", 'than type it from scratch. Give me just one second. So first of all, you\\n', 'need to be able to take this double type column and\\n', \"convert that into DATETIME. So here's a problem with that. DATETIME expects you to\\n\", 'have an actual date. You need four digit year, two digit month, and\\n', 'then two digit day. How can you get\\n', 'around that problem? Well, your database table\\n', 'does have a startYear. You can consider\\n', 'the startYear to be 1st of January of\\n', 'that particular year. Work around solution, not\\n', 'the perfect solution, but if you really\\n', 'want to be able to use range between interval, you will have to convert\\n', 'this into DATETIME. So how can you cost a particular column\\n', 'into a different type? You need to use the\\n', 'cost SQL function. Cost SQL function is going\\n', 'to take as argument, the original column or the field name,\\n', \"which is startYear. And then you're going to\\n\", 'have to use the AS CLOSE to specify the details here, which is like you\\n', \"want to consider that as an UNSIGNED integer. And then I'm taking\\n\", \"the original column, and I want to be able to cost that into a dateType column. But before I do that, I'm going to concatenate\\n\", \"whatever year I already have with January 1st. So that's why I'm using the string manipulation\\n\", \"function concat here, and I'm adding on\\n\", '01 for the month, and then 01 for the date. Here is how you describe\\n', \"a DATETIME column. When you have four digit year, you're going to specify %Y, and then two digit month, %m, two digit date, %d. So I'm going to take\\n\", 'my double year, and cast that as a date time column with January 1st as the\\n', 'date for every row, and the year is going to be coming from the\\n', 'startYear column. And once I do that, I need to make sure to repeat the same computation\\n', 'inside my over class, same reasoning as the\\n', \"previous question. And the syntax here is, I'm going to say rows between whatever the number of rows\\n\", \"that's of interest to me, three preceding and\\n\", 'three following. So let me go ahead and\\n', 'run the code so that you can actually take a look\\n', 'at the result over here. So if to take a look\\n', \"at the movies in 1944, you're now going to get the\\n\", 'total votes coming from all the three movies released\\n', 'before the current movie in 1944 and three movies released after the\\n', \"current movie in 1944. I'm already over the\\n\", 'time by one minute. Thank you for giving\\n', \"me that extra minute. Let's wrap up the\\n\", 'lecture here today. Hopefully, this should\\n', 'help you wrap up P2. I will see all of\\n', 'you on Wednesday.']\n",
            "['>> Good afternoon,\\n', 'everyone. Happy Monday. I hope all of you had\\n', \"a lovely weekend. Let's get started\\n\", 'with logistics. Hopefully, this is\\n', 'not a surprise.

And thank you to all\\n', \"of the students who've been super helpful to me and my team to help us\\n\", 'figure out issues with both the project\\n', 'specification and the auto grader. Let me repeat the announcement\\n', 'from the previous lecture. It is necessary for\\n', 'you to go through the clarifications\\n', 'and fixes section. I believe there is still one pending unresolved\\n', \"issue from Question 23. We'll post an update\\n\", 'regarding that, hopefully by the end\\n', 'of the day today, and hopefully that\\n', 'should be the last fix or clarification that we make. The reason why it is essential\\n', 'for you to go through these clarifications and\\n', 'fixes is because last Friday, I made significant changes to the ordering requirements for some of the questions without\\n', 'the ordering enforcements. You might be able to pass the Autograder on your\\n', 'local execution version, but when we run it,\\n', 'it might not work. So to ensure that there is\\n', 'always consistency in terms of your result of a SQL query getting generated in\\n', \"a particular order. It's essential that you follow through all of these\\n\", 'clarifications and make sure that your solutions meet the updated requirements. Speaking of updated\\n', \"requirements, I believe I've tagged all of the changes as\\n\", 'updated requirements. You could quite literally\\n', 'search for updated on the README and figure out\\n', 'all of those changes. Any questions at all\\n', 'about Project P2? The next quiz for the semester will be\\n', \"released later today. I still haven't gotten a\\n\", \"chance to regrade Quiz 2. Please hold on to tight. I will most definitely do that. It's in my to-do list tasks of things\\n\", \"that I need to complete. Let's get started.\\n\", \"We quite couldn't cover SQL window functions at the end of the\\n\", 'previous lecture. You would need to know about window functions\\n', 'in order to be able to solve Questions\\n', \"31-35 in Project P2. So that's where we are going\\n\", \"to start today's lecture. As I mentioned previously, assuming that you've been\\n\", 'actively working on P2, you would probably want to bring down the Docker container, which you launch to solve P2, and then relaunch a\\n', 'new container and load the IMDB database if\\n', 'you would like to follow along with the\\n', 'lecture demo examples. Why? Simplistic reason, we\\n', 'only have 2GB of RAM in our current VM and just running one instance of Docker\\n', 'container with MySQL server, eats up about\\n', 'nearly a GB of RAM, so you do not want to be running two different Docker containers with individual MySQL servers. So if you do want to do that, the best way to go about that would be to increase\\n', 'the size of the VM, which we are not going\\n', \"to do as of now. That's why I have\\n\", 'all of the code for you to redownload\\n', 'and unzip the IMDB dataset and also populate the dataset into the\\n', \"My SQL database. I'm not going to\\n\", \"run those cells. I'm going to assume\\n\", \"if you need it, you'll run those\\n\", \"cells by yourself. Let's get started\\n\", 'by talking about what exactly are\\n', 'window functions. Window functions can also be usually referred to as\\n', 'analytic functions. Some of the database\\n', 'implementations even refer to window\\n', 'functions as OLAP functions, online analytic\\n', 'processing functions. Hopefully, all of you remember what OLAP structure stands for. OLAP is going to focus on\\n', \"row based transactions. That's what typical\\n\", 'databases do, hence the name OLAP functions. So, before we dive into\\n', \"the definitions here, I'd like to remind all of\\n\", 'you that all of the content inside the Notebook file\\n', 'is testable content, so you must treat all of the verbals content as if\\n']\n",
            "[\"regret it because it's going to take your time to even\\n\", 'get the setup ready. So that has to do\\n', \"with logistics. And let's see. I'm going to change\\n\", 'the lectures around a little bit today.\\n', \"Here's the funny part. I really wanted to spend the whole of today's lecture\\n\", 'going through SQL demo, but turns out that I crashed my VM right\\n', 'before the lecture. So the plan that I had\\n', \"in mind is not going to work out because I'm\\n\", 'running out of memory. I wanted to introduce\\n', 'the IMDb dataset. IMDb dataset is a huge dataset. So I actually had a sampled\\n', 'version of the dataset. Even the sample version\\n', 'is crashing my VM. Unfortunately, I\\n', 'did the testing on my Mac laptop which\\n', 'has eight GB of RAM. At this point during\\n', \"the semester, I don't want us to upgrade to a better VM because I feel\\n\", \"like we'll run out of the provided $100 credit before we hit the\\n\", \"end of the semester. I really don't want any of\\n\", \"you to be paying for GCP. So that's why I sampled the dataset rather\\n\", 'than upgrading the VM. That said, I have\\n', 'already solved P2. Your VM is not going to crash\\n', \"when you try to solve P2. I can guarantee you that because I've solved the entire project. So because of that, we are going to improvise a little bit. Because of the improvisation, let's cover relational\\n\", \"algebra first before. Let's see how far we get\\n\", 'with respect to sport demo, the Spotify dataset that\\n', 'I quite literally came up 10 minutes\\n', 'before the lecture. So first thing that I\\n', 'want to do is to answer the question from two lectures\\n', 'ago, which was about, what is the difference between the datetime format and the timestamp format\\n', 'for your data, given that the formatting\\n', 'is exactly the same? Here is a fundamental\\n', 'difference between how data scientists use\\n', 'datetime versus how data scientists and computer scientists\\n', 'use timestamp. Datetime is absolute time. Whatever time you\\n', 'have that created that particular record\\n', 'that is often associated with the datetime data type. So what does\\n', 'timestamp stand for? Turns out that timestamp\\n', \"in the world of computers begin on January 1st, 1970, that's the beginning\\n\", 'of time for all computers. So timestamp is typically\\n', 'not human readable. What exactly is timestamp? So if I want to know\\n', \"the current timestamp, that's going to be the\\n\", 'number of seconds that have elapsed since the beginning\\n', \"of January 1st, 1970. I'm sure all of\\n\", \"you can appreciate that that's going to\\n\", \"be a huge number. I'm talking about the\\n\", 'number of seconds that have elapsed since 1970. Even the number of years\\n', 'feels like a large number, so let alone the seconds. So how come both of\\n', 'them have the same formatting with respect to being able to\\n', 'define SQL schemas? So it turns out that the\\n', 'underlying formatting for the timestamp that they\\n', 'use within SQL schemas, is actually matching with the exact year-year,\\n', 'month-month, day-day, or minute, second format that\\n', 'you use for datetime. The only difference\\n', 'is typically, when you have\\n', \"timestamp information inside your database schema, you're going to be using that particular column\\n\", 'to keep track of when was the most recent change made to that\\n', 'particular data row, as opposed to datetime\\n', \"which is meant to store when was this data created? For instance, let's say that\\n\", \"you're storing event data. Let's say that you have a table of all the political\\n\", 'debates that have happened, and you have rows of entries, and one of the columns\\n', 'obviously need to be the date and the\\n', 'time of the event. Datetime will be the formatting\\n', \"example for such a data. As opposed to that, let's\\n\", 'say that for the same row, you have a couple of\\n', 'columns indicating how the American people reacted to the outcome of the presidential\\n', \"debate, for example. Assuming that you're\\n\", \"not Donald Trump, assuming that you're\\n\", \"a sane person, you'll probably have valid\\n\", 'numbers to put it in there. And when you put those\\n', \"valid numbers in, you're actually updating\\n\", 'that particular row, otherwise known as a tuple, otherwise known as a record, whatever terminology\\n', 'that you can use for that particular\\n', \"row of data. When you do that, that's when you update the timestamp field. Hopefully, the\\n\", 'difference between timestamp versus\\n', 'datetime is clear. Any other follow up questions? Let me dive into\\n', 'relational algebra now. So the high level learning objectives for this\\n', 'particular lecture is to being able to recognize and learn basic relational\\n', 'algebra operators. Many of you in here might\\n', 'be familiar with SQL. Not all of you will probably be familiar with\\n', \"relational algebra. And I'll shortly talk about why relational algebra\\n\", \"is super significant. We're also going to learn two different types of\\n\", 'relational algebra operators, the basic operators and\\n', \"the derived operators. Let's get started by\\n\", \"talking about how exactly a SQL engine works. So I'm not going to\\n\", 'go into a lot of details of how exactly\\n', \"query optimization works. If at all, you're interested in learning that particular aspect of database management systems, again, the course that\\n\", 'you need to look for is 564 and not this current course. So typically, whenever you have a database\\n', \"management system, you'll be writing SQL queries\\n\", 'in order to create tables, insert data into your tables, and then do data\\n', 'retrieval and analysis. So SQL queries are some\\n', 'form of declaration. So SQL is not considered\\n', \"a programming language. That's why SQL stands for\\n\", \"structured query language. It's a declarative query\\n\", \"form where you're going to use that syntax to\\n\", 'query your data source, which happens to be a\\n', 'database management system. And then once you have the\\n', \"basic declarative form, you're going to come up with a relational algebra plan for\\n\", 'that particular SQL query. And then with the\\n', 'relational algebra plan, you can plug in various\\n', 'optimization techniques in order to make sure\\n', 'that your database is actually going to be able\\n', 'to process your queries in a super fast manner\\n', 'to be able to return the result of execution as quickly\\n', 'as possible to you. Again, computer\\n', 'scientists who work on database architectures will be interested in this\\n', \"third piece over here. We're only going to focus\\n\", 'on the second piece and how it relates\\n', \"to SQL queries. Let's get started by learning about the basic SQL operators, otherwise known as\\n\", 'primitive operators. You have about five primitive operators which are selection, projection, cartesian product,\\n', \"union, and set difference. We'll talk about each of those operators using a learning management\\n\", \"system example, and then we'll dive\\n\", 'into derived operators. Selection, otherwise\\n', \"known as WHERE clause, that's something that I'm\\n\", 'hoping all of you will retain, this is the second time\\n', \"I'm introducing the term, is going to enable you to\\n\", 'narrow down two tuples of data. Again, tuple is nothing\\n', 'but a row of data, or it can also be called\\n', 'as a record of data, whatever terminology\\n', \"that you use. It's going to enable\\n\", 'you to narrow down tuples that satisfy a\\n', 'particular condition. The notation is\\n', \"going to be Sigma, and then you're going to specify Sigma followed by whatever\\n\", 'the condition is, which is C, and then within\\n', \"the pair of parentheses, you're going to mention\\n\", 'your relation name. Relation name denoted by R here is nothing but\\n', \"the name of your table. Let's go through an example with the LMS example that\\n\", \"we've been using. For example, remember that the students table\\n\", \"contained three columns, student ID, name, GPA. Let's say that you're\\n\", 'interested in filtering out all of the students who have\\n', 'GPA greater than 3.5. So here is this\\n', 'SQL query for it. So it involves\\n', 'three SQL clauses. SELECT and FROM are considered as the\\n', 'mandatory SQL clauses. Yes, there could be some SQL queries where\\n', 'you will be able to write the queries\\n', \"without the from clause, but we're not going to\\n\", 'talk about that subset. For the purpose of this course, we are going to assume\\n', 'that all SQL queries must have SELECT\\n', 'and from clause. So the SELECT clause is going to enable you\\n', \"to narrow down columns. That's going to be projection, which is coming up shortly. And then the FROM\\n\", 'clause is going to enable you to specify\\n', \"the relation name, which is the name of the table, which is students over here. What does the WHERE clause do? WHERE clause does selection. You're going to associate\\n\", 'WHERE clause with a condition. The condition in this example is going to be GPA\\n', 'greater than 3.5. One thing that I would like to mention about WHERE clause, in Python or in any other\\n', \"programming language, you're typically used to using double equal to for equality. Turns out that in SQL, single equal to is\\n\", \"considered equality as well. So both of those should work. Just in case, and if you're\\n\", 'looking for a student who has exact GPA of 3.5, you can rewrite this query\\n', 'to say GPA equal to 3.5, or GPA double equal to 3.5. Now, what is the relational\\n', \"algebra notation for this particular query? You're going to have to use the mathematical notation,\\n\", 'which is Sigma. And then what is our condition? GPA greater than 3.5. And then within a\\n', \"pair of parentheses, you're going to\\n\", 'have to mention the relation name,\\n', 'which is students. So let me make this\\n', 'clear so that all of you have set expectations\\n', 'for the next week question, also for the exam. Given a SQL query, you should be able to write the relational algebra\\n', 'expression for that particular SQL\\n', 'query, and vice versa. Given a relational\\n', 'algebra expression, you should be able to convert\\n', 'that into a SQL query, assuming that I provide all of the required details for you with the other way\\n', 'around conversion. Other examples for\\n', \"selection would be, let's say that you have an\\n\", 'employee table and you want to select all employees who have salary greater than some amount, or you want to select the tuples associated\\n', \"with a specific employee, let's say that\\n\", 'somebody named Smith. The condition here is\\n', 'typically associated with any comparison operators\\n', 'which are equal to, less than, less\\n', 'than or equal to, greater than, greater than\\n', 'and equal to and so on. Any questions about the\\n', 'relational algebra notation or the SQL query format? >> So next stop, you have projection, otherwise known as\\n', 'the select clause. So let me make this\\n', 'absolutely clear. Selection is not associated\\n', 'with select clause. A lot of people get confused because of the similar naming. Projection is the name\\n', 'for the select clause and the mathematical operator\\n', 'for projection is Pi, not the greatest\\n', 'representation of Phi, but somewhere close to that. So in the previous example, we did cover a select clause, let me go back there. I had an asterix there. What does the asterix denote? It denotes wildcard\\n', 'that indicates that we are going to\\n', 'select all of the columns. So what does the projection, otherwise known as select\\n', \"clausem enable us to do? It's going to enable us\\n\", 'to eliminate columns depending on whatever\\n', 'requirement we have. Not only does it\\n', 'enable us to select a specific subset or\\n', 'all of the columns, it can also enable\\n', 'us to eliminate duplicates within the tuples associated with a\\n', \"particular column. For example, let's say that there are two\\n\", \"mics in the course, and for some reason, I don't want to have, two different mic entries as part of my query output here. What can I do? I can say select, and then followed by\\n\", \"which I'm going to use the SQL keyword distinct, followed by which\\n\", 'you are going to say whatever column name for which you want to\\n', 'eliminate the duplicates. The notation for\\n', 'projection is going to be similar to selection. Instead of Sigma,\\n', 'you now have Pi, and then you have all of the attributes that\\n', \"you're trying to select. Remember that column names\\n\", \"are also known as attributes. So you're going to have\\n\", \"a bunch of attributes. In this query example, we're selecting name\\n\", \"and the GPA columns. So I'm going to list the\\n\", \"relational algebra expression as Pi name, GPA, and then the relation, again, is going to be students. I've given you a couple of\\n\", 'other examples, for instance, selecting SSN and name\\n', 'from employee table in order to determine SSN\\n', 'of various employees. Any questions before we talk\\n', 'about compositional nature of relational algebra\\n', \"operators? So here's the thing. You can always take output of one relational algebra\\n\", 'operator and provide that as an input to another\\n', 'relational algebra operator. So relational algebra\\n', \"operators are compositional. Let's consider an\\n\", \"example SQL query here. Let's put both of those examples together from\\n\", \"projection and selection. I'm going to select\\n\", 'the distinct name and the GPA from the students table for all the students who\\n', 'satisfy this condition, which is GPA greater than 3.5. Now, here is a question. How\\n', 'do you actually represent this query in\\n', \"relational algebra? I've given you two\\n\", 'different notations. I want all of you to take\\n', 'a minute to look through those and answer this question, which is, are these\\n', \"logically equivalent? I've, actually, given\\n\", 'you already the answer. The answer is, no. But why are they not\\n', 'logically equivalent? Think about that for a minute, and maybe one of you can give me suggestions as to why they\\n', 'are not logically equivalent. Or rather, let me\\n', 'rephrase this question. Put up one finger, if\\n', 'you think the first one should be the correct\\n', 'relational algebra expression, put up two fingers if\\n', 'you think the second one should be the correct\\n', 'relational algebra expression. A lot of mixed answers, but many of you\\n', 'are giving me one. Can one of you who\\n', 'raised their hand with one finger volunteer and tell me why one should be the\\n', 'correct answer. Yes. >> Maybe because we are first filtering and putting\\n', 'the condition and then we are getting\\n', 'the results and then showing all the\\n', \"results that we got. Because in second case, we're technically just showing everything and\\n\", 'selecting and then not showing it again. >> Makes total sense. So\\n', 'here is the question. Her thought was like,\\n', 'in the first option, first option is the\\n', 'correct option, just so that I can\\n', 'make it clear. Why is the first\\n', \"option correct option? Wherever you're doing\\n\", 'condition based filtering, it is important\\n', 'that you apply that first before you\\n', 'do anything else. Why is that significant? What if we consider the\\n', 'second option to be a viable relational algebra\\n', \"expression for this query? Let's say that I mess this up and while doing\\n\", 'the projection, instead of selecting\\n', 'both name and GPA, I somehow end up\\n', \"only selecting name. Will that query work? Not really, because you're\\n\", 'now having another component, which is the\\n', 'selection component, which is dependent on you\\n', 'projecting the GPA column. There is no guarantee\\n', 'that whoever is using your SQL\\n', 'server is going to, actually, do the\\n', 'projection here correctly. So these are not\\n', 'logically equivalent so where actually occurs\\n', 'first in SQL processing, and then only select\\n', 'actually gets executed. So the first one is the correct relational\\n', 'algebra expression for this particular SQL\\n', \"query. Yeah, question. >> [inaudible] >> That's a very good question, and that's actually\\n\", \"taking us to make area. That's exactly what query\\n\", \"optimizers are focused on.

If you're creating a brand\\n\", \"new database from your own, using your own design, maybe for some specific reason, you'd want to write your\\n\", 'optimizer that way. But other than coming up with the database\\n', \"design from scratch, you're not going\\n\", 'to be able to do the second relational\\n', 'algebra like typical database\\n', 'implementations. Question again. >> [inaudible] >> For the relational\\n', \"algebra expression, that's a really good question. I think you should be\\n\", \"able to write a star, but let me put a pen on that and I'll come back\\n\", 'to that question with a confident answer maybe at the beginning\\n', \"of the next lecture. I'm not super\\n\", \"confident about it. >> [inaudible] >> I don't know an answer\\n\", \"to that question either. That's, also, a good question. I don't believe distinct has a relational algebra operator\\n\", 'dedicated to itself. But I think you can\\n', 'just quite simply use the distinct keyword within your relational algebra\\n', 'formula underneath the Pi. But, again, that would\\n', \"just be my guess. I don't know the actual answer\\n\", 'to your question, either. Really good questions. Any other question? Two\\n', \"unanswered questions. We're going to come back\\n\", \"to that next lecture. Let's move on to the next one, which is cross product, otherwise, known as\\n\", 'Cartesian product. A little bit legacy\\n', \"relational algebra operator because people don't\\n\", \"really use these anymore. I'll give you an example\\n\", 'for this shortly. So cross product is\\n', 'going to give you all possible combinations of all the tuples from\\n', 'relation 1 and relation 2. The notation for\\n', 'that is going to be R1*R2 or\\n', 'multiplication symbol R2, whatever you want to use uses the readability\\n', 'term for that. An example of that would be us doing a cross product\\n', 'between students table, which is supposed to store\\n', 'all the student ID, name, and GPA information\\n', 'with the enroll table, which is actually storing the enrollments of individual students to\\n', 'individual courses. So now, let me show you an\\n', 'actual example of that. These are the student in the enrolled tables from the\\n', 'previous lecture slides. When you do a cross\\n', \"between those, you'll end up with\\n\", \"four rows with all of the column options over here. You're going to have all of the data just literally\\n\", 'combined together, all combinations of\\n', \"all of the tuples. Feels like it's redundant. Why do you need, all\\n\", \"of these combinations? Which is why it's considered\\n\", \"a little bit legacy. People use joints instead of using cross products nowadays. Let's talk about union set\\n\", 'difference and intersection. I mentioned that union and set difference are\\n', 'primitive operators. Intersection is actually\\n', 'a derived operator. Actually, quite literally\\n', 'have formula for intersection being derived from set difference below over here. Hopefully, all of\\n', 'you are familiar with the three terms over here. Union is going to give you all possible tuples from two\\n', 'different relationships. Intersection is going to\\n', 'give you set difference from R1-R2 is only going to give you the\\n', \"tuples only in R1, and it's going to remove\\n\", \"everything else that is in R2 and then vice versa. If you do R2-R1, you're only going to get\\n\", 'only R2 and nothing from R1. And this subtitle should be\\n', \"intersection. My apologies. I'll fix it after the lecture. The third one is\\n\", 'going to talk about intersection denoted by R1\\n', 'intersection R2 over here. Intersection is nothing but set difference R1\\n', \"set difference R2, which gives you just the overlap between those two relations. I've given you a\\n\", 'theoretical examples of how you could apply\\n', 'each of these operators. For instance, you can do union between 639 and 544 students to figure out how many of them\\n', 'are taking both courses, set difference to\\n', 'figure out how many of you are only taking 639 and union to figure out all\\n', 'of the 639 and 544 students, intersection to figure out\\n', \"only the subset of students who are taking both 639 and 544. I'm not going to spend\\n\", 'too much time on that slide because I\\n', 'feel like all of you should be very familiar with the basic mathematical\\n', \"operators there. Let's move on to the next\\n\", 'relational algebra operator, which is renaming. The operator that we use\\n', \"to denote this is Rho. You're going to have the relational\\n\", 'algebra expression or the notation as Rho, followed by which you are\\n', \"going to mention whatever is the new name of the column that you're trying\\n\", 'to fetch from the relation. This is the shortened form. The actual long form of this\\n', 'notation would be to say, what is the original\\n', 'name of your attribute? What is the new name\\n', 'of the attribute? And then keep that going for all N attributes from\\n', \"your table schema. Here is an example. Let's say that we want SID\\n\", 'to be more descriptive. The keyword that you use in SQL clause with respect\\n', \"to being able to rename a particular column or an attribute is the as keyword. You're going to say select, followed by which you'll specify\\n\", \"the current column name, and then you'll say as, and then followed by\\n\", 'which you are going to specify the new column name. Renaming is actually considered\\n', \"as a special operator. It's considered neither\\n\", 'basic nor derived, so people put it like\\n', \"anywhere that they want to. Don't worry. I'm not going\\n\", 'to ask you a question, which will probably trick you into thinking whether you should place it in either\\n', 'of those categories. So if you use the relational\\n', \"algebra notation, you're just going to say Rho\\n\", 'followed by the [inaudible]. Shortened form would be all\\n', 'the new attribute names, which would be\\n', 'student_ID, student_name, and grade_point_average\\n', 'over here. Any questions about\\n', \"basic operators before we move on to derived operators? So let's talk about\\n\", 'derived operators. The original slide\\n', 'said intersection renaming and other\\n', 'operators like join. Let me expand that. Natural join is the most\\n', 'commonly used join category. There is also another\\n', \"join called Theta join. I'll tell you the difference\\n\", 'between the both shortly. I have an example for\\n', 'the regular join, which is also otherwise\\n', \"known as inner join. So I don't have a slide example\\n\", \"for left and right joins. We'll cover a demo\\n\", 'example for those. Other than joins, you also have other operations\\n', 'like aggregation, and then you have grouping, and then you have division. You have operators for\\n', \"grouping and division. Let's dive into\\n\", 'natural join first. What is the notation? You are going to\\n', \"use this symbol. I'm just blanking out on the mathematical\\n\", 'term for the symbol. There should be one. If\\n', 'somebody knows, let me know. This denotes join between\\n', 'relation R1 and R2. What exactly does join\\n', 'enable you to do? Join is going to enable you to find a good way of\\n', 'being able to combine data one relation to another rather than\\n', 'a Cartesian product, which literally gives\\n', 'you all combinations. Join is going to do it a little bit more\\n', 'cleanly and not have, all of the combinations. So typically, the inner join is going to be based on the\\n', 'equality relationship. What do I mean by\\n', \"equality relationship? Let's directly take an example. Student stable and Enroll\\n\", 'table both contain SID. Hopefully, all of you remember from our configuration that SID in student table\\n', 'is primary key, SID and enroll table\\n', \"is foreign key. So what you're going to do now, in order to be able to apply inner join between\\n\", \"these two tables, is to quite literally say, I have the wrong SQL query here. Let's, actually, fix this. Give me one second. I have select from and then\\n\", \"I'm missing the join part. Give me a second.\\n\", \"Make type that, join, and then I'm going\\n\", 'to have to say this. And then on what\\n', \"is the condition? I think when I placed with that, two mistakes so far. We'll fix that. Just\\n\", \"give me one second. I'm going to quickly\\n\", \"fix the other one, too. I am fixing mistakes. I'll upload the updated\\n\", 'version of the slide deck. >> Now, going back to\\n', \"the inner join example, you're going to say Select, and then a bunch\\n\", \"of column names. And then FROM clause, you're going to select one\\n\", \"of the tables as the base, for example, let's take the students table\\n\", 'as the base here. Often, a lot of programmers will create a name for that\\n', \"particular table so that it's easy for you to type the shortened name instead\\n\", 'of saying tablename.column. When do you have to say\\n', \"table name.column name? Whenever there is a conflict, you're going to have to\\n\", 'explicitly say which one of those relation columns that\\n', \"you're trying to refer to. For instance, there are\\n\", 'two student ID columns here, sid columns. So you need to explicitly say, student table is where\\n', \"I'm going to get this information from because\\n\", \"it's the primary key there. So I'm going to\\n\", \"explicitly say S.sid, but I don't have to explicitly say S.name because there is only one name when you\\n\", 'consider a combination of both of those\\n', 'tables put together. Same thing with cid,\\n', 'there is only one cid. So the syntax for JOIN is going to be after\\n', 'the FROM clause, the FROM clause is going to\\n', 'mention one of the tables. The JOIN clause is going\\n', \"to mention another table, which you're going to do the JOIN with the\\n\", \"original table. So I'm saying enrolled E, and then I need to\\n\", 'have an on clause, which has to tell\\n', 'me what exactly is the condition for the\\n', 'JOIN and for innerjoin, typically this\\n', \"condition is going to be based on equality. Here I'm saying, take\\n\", 'all of the tuples, put them together by applying\\n', 'equality relationship between student sid\\n', 'and enrolled sid. Any questions at all\\n', 'about inner join? So you can either type\\n', 'and literally inner join or you could type and join as well both of those will work. I often type just join, because typing in one\\n', 'more word is extra work. So Join is an example\\n', \"of a derived operator. I've given you the\\n\", \"mathematical relationship from the Cartesian product, which is going to enable us to actually derive at the joins. Feel free to go through this, I'm not going to test you on that mathematical expression I just wanted to give\\n\", 'you an example of why it is called a derived operator\\n', 'because we can actually derive it from\\n', 'the basic operators. Any questions about natural join before we move on to Theta join? One simple basic difference between natural join\\n', 'and Theta join. In natural join,\\n', 'your condition is always equality\\n', 'and in Theta join, your condition can be anything less than greater than\\n', 'less than or equal to, greater than or equal to. And typically, most of\\n', 'the requirements for analysis will\\n', 'actually require you to use natural join\\n', \"and no Theta join. So I'm not giving\\n\", 'you an example here. There is another\\n', 'notation for Theta join. You have the same\\n', 'natural join symbol, and then you say_Theta for that. Any questions about joins before we move on\\n', 'to aggregations? Aggregations, the name should be self intuitive sum.\\n', 'What does it do? It gives you the total of all the column values associated with all\\n', 'of the row tuples. Count, what does it do? It enables you to count\\n', 'up the number of, data tuples associated either with a particular column or you could also\\n', 'use a wildcard. You can combine count with distinct to be able\\n', 'to come up with distinct count for a\\n', 'particular columns values. There is only count\\n', 'the unique values associated with a particular\\n', 'column or an attribute. Average, you can either use, sum and then divide\\n', 'that by count in order to come\\n', 'up with an average or you could actually use AVG, whatever feels appropriate\\n', 'to you, both the equalent. And then you have min and max those should be\\n', 'self explanatory, minimum value of the column and maximum value of the column. I got to move on\\n', \"to grouping next. Gamma, that's the\\n\", 'notation for grouping. What exactly does grouping\\n', 'enable you to do? Grouping is going to enable\\n', 'you to create subsets of rows based on unique value\\n', \"of a particular column. For example, let's say that\\n\", \"I'm interested in doing some statistics by\\n\", \"individual courses from the enrolled table. For instance, let's say that\\n\", \"I'm interested in learning how many of you\\n\", 'enrolled per course. The syntax for that in SQL is going to be\\n', 'the group by clause. It comes after the select\\n', 'and the from clause. There is a specific\\n', 'ordering for all of these clauses put\\n', \"together we'll cover that next lecture\\n\", 'during the demo. But for the sake\\n', \"of this example, it's going to be select count\\n\", \"of star aggregate function. I'm saying star because\\n\", \"it doesn't really matter for me to count distinct. I want all of the students. Count of star, every\\n\", 'data row is going to be a single student from\\n', 'the enrolled table, group by course ID. This is going to give me\\n', 'unique number of rows as there are the unique\\n', 'number of course IDs so every course ID is\\n', \"going to end up with a row in my result. Then against each course ID, I'm going to be able\\n\", 'to do the aggregation, which is going to be counting\\n', 'up the number of students. Rule of them for all of you to remember with respect\\n', 'to group by clause, whenever you have\\n', 'a group by clause, your select clause can only contain one of\\n', 'these two things. It can either be an\\n', 'aggregate function, an example would be\\n', 'count or it should be one of the things from\\n', 'the group by clause. Majority of the SQL servers actually throw an\\n', 'error when you have some other column name or an attribute name\\n', \"within your select clause, which you don't have within\\n\", \"your group by clause. Why is that significant? When you're doing groupings\\n\", \"of your rows of your dataset, you're actually combining all of the tuple information based on a particular unique value\\n\", 'of a particular column. Can I get all of the student name information\\n', 'if I group by course ID? Not really, because all\\n', 'of those are going to get collapsed into a\\n', 'single row because all 639 students\\n', 'are going to get represented using\\n', \"one aggregate row. It doesn't really make\\n\", 'any sense for you to have anything else other\\n', 'than aggregate and the group by column or columns within the\\n', 'select clause. The notation for\\n', \"this is going to be you're going\\n\", \"to mention Gamma, then you're going to\\n\", 'mention A_1, A_2, etc, up to A_n which\\n', \"are going to be the group by column attributes. In this example, that's\\n\", \"going to be cid, and I'm also going to\\n\", 'mention at the end, what are all the aggregate\\n', \"functions that I'm using, which would be count of star in this example and against\\n\", 'the enrolled table. Any questions on the fundamentals\\n', \"of the group by class? I'm just going to\\n\", \"spend one quick minute on the division operator, and then we're going to move\\n\", \"on to the improvised demo. Let's talk about actually\\n\", \"before that, let's do Top Hat. The division operator, so\\n\", \"it's going to enable you to, find all of the students who satisfy a particular condition. A good example with elements would be\\n\", 'trying to find all of the students who have completed their graduation requirement\\n', 'for a particular degree. Note that we have\\n', 'a brand new schema for the students table.
